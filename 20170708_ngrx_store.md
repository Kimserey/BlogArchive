# Managing global state with Ngrx store in Angular

The goal of Angular components is to be completely independent. This can lead to mismatch of displayed data where one component isn't in sync with what other components are displaying. One solution is to have a stateful service shared among all components and delivering global data. This can be problematic when multiple pieces have to be globally accessible among multiple components. In this situation, the need for a global state becomes inevitable.

Global state has had a bad reputation since inception due to its unpredictable nature. 
About two years ago, Redux was introduced as a way to manage this unpredictability by making the state immutable and operations acting on the state synchronous and stateless functions (a similiar approach can be found in the actor pattern). 
Since then, its principales has inspired multiple implementations, one of them being the Ngrx store for Angular.
Today I will go through the library and build a sample application demonstrating how Ngrx store can be used to share a global state and deliver continuous updates. This post will be composed of [] part.
