# Microsoft Project Orleans 2.0.0 beta 3 to 2.0.0 stable

Microsoft Project Orleans just released its 2.0.0 stabe version. This version embodies an enormous amount of enhancements, fixes, refactor, new functionalities but above all in my perspective, moving to dotnet standard, aligning to the philosophy behind asp.net core with the configuration framework and logging framework provided by Microsoft.Extensions, and lastly providing a direct configuration easy to use with comprehensible separations of API to boot clients and silos.
Today I want to take the time to explain how the migration between beta 3 and stable can be done in three parts:

1. What changed
2. Configure ClientBuilder
3. Configure SiloBuilder

## 1. What changed

Back in 1.5, we used to configure client and silo using `ClientConfiguration` and `ClusterConfiguration`. One of the biggest confusion was __why do we configure the cluster? Aren't we configuring Silo?__.
Moving forward with the introduction of dotnet standard, it made sense to start to shift in order to take advantage of the cross platform capibilities of dotnet (leverage cheaper linux box or leverage container services).
Along the months, in the multiple alpha/beta releases more changes happened to evolve Orleans without breaking changes, some properties were added to supersede others while obsolete ones not being removed.

_For example the seed nodes configuration, I had a hard time to understand as it was an array but it turns out to be an obsolete configuration and was supposed to be a single value pointing to the primary node._

It was hard to understand how to configure properly a Silo and a Client.

Moving forward to 2.0.0, __ClientConfiguration and ClusterConfiguration no longer exist YAY!!__
It has now been replaced by a `ClientBuilder` and a `SiloBuilder` (notice there is no cluster builder).

## 2. Configure the ClientBuilder

A client needs to connect to a cluster. The only configuration needed for the client is therefore:

1. the id of the cluster
2. the id of the service
3. where to find the cluster

During beta this used to be configured in `ClientConfiguration`, it is now done using the `ClientBuilder`:

```c#
IClusterClient client = new ClientBuilder()
  // 1. and 2. the id of the cluster and id of the service
  .Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
  {
      options.ClusterId = "cluster";
      options.ServiceId = "service";
  })
   // 3. where to find the cluster
  .UseAzureStorageClustering(options =>
  {
      options.ConnectionString = "storage connection string";
  })
  .ConfigureApplicationParts(x => x.AddApplicationPart(typeof(IAccount).Assembly).WithReferences())
  .ConfigureLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
  .Build();
```

Those settings allow the client to know where to find the cluster by pointing to the location membership table.

## 3. Configure the SiloBuilder

A silo needs more configurations. It is the runtime for the grains. If we leverage the grain storage, the streams and the reminders, we would need to configure the following:

1. the id of the cluster and service
2. where to find the cluster to join it
3. the silo internal port (for silo to silo communication, inter cluster)
4. the silo gateway port (for client communiction)
5. the silo hostname
6. the grain storage
7. the stream service
8. the reminder type and storage if needed

During beta this used to be configured in `ClusterConfiguration`, it is now done using the `SiloBuilder`:

```c#
ISiloHost host = new SiloHostBuilder()
    // 1. the id of the cluster and service
    .Configure<ClusterOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.ClusterId = "";
        options.ServiceId = "";
    })
    // 2. where to find the cluster to join it
    .UseAzureStorageClustering(options => options.ConnectionString = "")
    // 3. and 4. and 5. the ports public/private and the hostname of the silo
    .ConfigureEndpoints(
        siloPort: 22000,
        gatewayPort: 32000,
        hostname: IPAddress.Loopback.ToString()
    )
    // 6. the grain storage
    .AddAzureBlobGrainStorage("default", options =>
    {
        options.ConnectionString = "connection";
        options.ContainerName = "grain-container";
    })
    // This store is needed as rendez point for streams for 7.
    .AddAzureBlobGrainStorage("PubSubStore", options =>
    {
        options.ConnectionString = "";
        options.ContainerName = "";
    })
    // 7. the stream service
    .AddSimpleMessageStreamProvider("default", (SimpleMessageStreamProviderOptions options) =>
    {
        options.FireAndForgetDelivery = true;
    })
    // 8. the reminder type and storage if needed
    .UseInMemoryReminderService()
    .ConfigureApplicationParts(x =>
    {
        x.AddApplicationPart(typeof(AccountGrain).Assembly).WithReferences();
    })
    .ConfigureLogging(b => b.AddConsole())
    .Build();
```

This will allow the silo to boot properly, join the cluster it is meant to be in, save grain state, save reminders and utilise the streams configured.

In the example we demonstrated configuration of a cluster on Azure with all storage using AzureBlobStorage and clustering using AzureTable with stream using AzureStorage queues.

__This is also one of the major changes; the libraries have been split into meaningful libraries and meaningful namespaces.__

- The clustering is provided by the library `Microsoft.Orleans.Clustering.xxx`,
- The storage persistence is provided by the library `Microsoft.Orleans.Persistence.xxx`,
- The reminders are provided by the library `Microsoft.Orleans.Reminders.xxx`.

Here we are using Azure so everything was with `.AzureStorage` but if we were to use AWS, we could import `.DynamoDB` and we will have access to the extensions to use DynamoDB as clustering, backing storage for grains and reminders.
