# Undertand Xamarin Forms data bindings in FSharp

In Xamarin.Forms, interacting with buttons, labels, lists and all other controls is done via data bindings.
Data bindings is one of the core component of the MVVM pattern (model - view - viewmodel). 
It provides a way to isolate model - view - viewmodel and therefore allows them to be swapped independently (for example for UI changes by swapping with another view or for testing purposes by swapping the viewmodel).

There is a very good tutorial on the Xamarin website about data bindings [https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data_binding_basics/](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data_binding_basics/).
In Xamarin.Forms, everything that can be done in XAML can be coded in C# which means that __we can code everything in F#__.

The problem with coding the view in F# is that we can easily to mix the views and viewmodels since there is no visible separation.
Whereas with XAML, it is obvious that the XAML file is the view and the code linked to the view is the viewmodel, there a visible (language) and physical (files) separation.
But this can be achieved from the code by understanding how to keep views isolated from viewmodels and vice versa.

Today I would like to show you how you can use __data bindings to remove any dependencies between views and viewmodels__ while build Xamarin.Forms application in F#.

```

2. ListView and Observable collections
3. Commands

## 1. Data bindings

During the rest of this tutorial we will refer to the UI components as `View` and to the type which orchestrates the view as `ViewModel`.
So when we talk about `View` we might be referring to a button, or a page, or a list, all these are UI components.

Every bindable components from Xamarin.Forms inherit from `BindableObject`.
`BindableObject` exposes a method with few overload to bind properties of the current object to a viewmodel `SetBinding`.

The overload that I use the most is an extension allowing to pass a `BindableProperty` and a string `path`.

```
// C#
public static void SetBinding(
    this BindableObject self, 
    BindableProperty targetProperty, 
    string path, 
    BindingMode mode = BindingMode.Default, 
    IValueConverter converter = null,
    string stringFormat = null)
```

### Binding a label

All UI components expose static members which provide links to their `BindableProperty`.
For example a`Label` has a bindable `Text` property.

```
type MyPage(viewmodel: obj) as self =
    inherit ContentPage(Title = "Label sample")

    let label = new Label()

    do
        label.SetBinding(Label.TextProperty, "Text")
        self.BindingContext <- viewmodel
        self.Content <- label
``` 

Here we define a page which sets a binding on its title property.

The viewmodel is a simple type which provides the bindings required by the view.
It does it by implementing properties with matching name given to the bindings.

For the previous example, we will have a `MyPageViewModel` with a property `Title`.

```
type MyPageViewModel() =
    member self.Text with get() = "Hey"
```

When the binding context (the viewmodel) is set, the property `Text` of the viewmodel is fetched with the `get`.
In our example, we bind the text to a property which never changes but what if we need to bind to a property which changes over the time.

### Change label text via an entry input

Let's start by modifying the view to have the label and entry.

```
type MyPage(viewmodel: obj) as self =
    inherit ContentPage(Title = "Label and entry sample")

    let label = new Label()
    let entry = new Entry()
    let layout =
        let layout = new StackLayout()
        layout.Children.Add(label)
        layout.Children.Add(entry)
        layout

    do
        label.SetBinding(Label.TextProperty, "Text")
        entry.SetBinding(Entry.TextProperty, "Text")
        self.BindingContext <- viewmodel
        self.Content <- layout

type MyPageViewModel() =

    let mutable text = "Default text"

    member self.Text 
        with get() = text
        and set value = 
            text <- value
            Debug.WriteLine("Value set: {0}", value)
```

We create a vertical stacked layout which contains the label and entry and define a viewmodel with a default text for the entry and a `set` function for the `property` which sets the underlying variable `text`.
We also write to the Application output via `Debug.WriteLine` just to check if everything works fine.

When we run the application we can see the default text appearing on the layout but when we change the entry, the label doesn't change.
If we check the application log, we can see that the value is correctly set on the viewmodel.

__The binding of the entry property sets the underlying property but the label `binding isn't notified` that the underlying value `has changed`.__

In order to notify the label that the value has changed, we need the viewmodel to implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`.
Since all viewmodels will need to notify to the UI that their properties changed, we will create a base viewmodel which implements `INotifyPropertyChanged`.

```
type ViewModelBase() =
    let propertyChanging = new Event<PropertyChangingEventHandler, PropertyChangingEventArgs>()
    let propertyChanged  = new Event<PropertyChangedEventHandler,  PropertyChangedEventArgs>()

    interface INotifyPropertyChanged with
        [<CLIEvent>]
        member self.PropertyChanged = propertyChanged.Publish
    
    member self.PropertyChanging = propertyChanging.Publish

    member self.OnPropertyChanging name =
        propertyChanging.Trigger(self, new PropertyChangingEventArgs(name))

    member self.OnPropertyChanged name =
        propertyChanged.Trigger(self, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(name))
```

Now using we can notify the label or any other views which bind to the `Text` property.

```
type MyPageViewModel() =
    inherit ViewModelBase()

    let mutable text = "Default text"

    member self.Text 
        with get() = text
        and set value = 
            base.OnPropertyChanging "Text"
            text <- value
            Debug.WriteLine("Value set: {0}", value)
            base.OnPropertyChanged "Text"
```

And now we get __a two way binding on the text property which updates the views and gets updated by the entry___.

## 2. ListView and Observable collections

To display lists, Xamarin.Forms provides a `ListView` which derives from the abstract class `ItemsView` which provides bindable property `ItemSources`.
The only requirement is that the source must implement `IEnumerable` therefore if we need to bind a static list we can bind a `seq` or a `list`.

```
type MyPage(viewmodel: obj) as self =
    inherit ContentPage(Title = "ListView sample")

    let listView = 
        new ListView(ItemTemplate = new DataTemplate(typeof<TextCell>))

    do
        self.BindingContext <- viewmodel
        listView.SetBinding(ListView.ItemsSourceProperty, "List")
        listView.ItemTemplate.SetBinding(TextCell.TextProperty, "Name")
        self.Content <- listView

type MyPageViewModel() =

    member self.List 
        with get() = 
            [ { Name = "Greg"; Age = 29 }
                { Name = "Tom"; Age = 29 }
                { Name = "Sam"; Age = 29 } ]
```

In order to display the list, a data template must be used.
You can create your own by inheriting from `ViewCell` or you can use the default one, `TextCell` is one of the default one.
`TextCell` provides several bindings like `TextProperty` or `DetailProperty` which allows us to bind to certain property of the cell.
Another default cell is `ImageCell` which gives access to an `ImageSourceProperty`.

Another way of passing the template to `DataTemplate` is to do it via a function:

```
new ListView(ItemTemplate = new DataTemplate(fun () -> box <| new MyTextCell()))
```

This can be useful if we need to pass any argument to the template constructor.
Creating your own cell template can be done this way:

```
type MyTextCell() as self =
    inherit ViewCell()

    let name = new Label()
    let age = new Label()
    let layout =
        let layout = new StackLayout(Orientation = StackOrientation.Horizontal)
        layout.Children.Add(name)
        layout.Children.Add(age)
        layout

    do
        name.SetBinding(Label.TextProperty, "Name", stringFormat = "{0},")
        age.SetBinding(Label.TextProperty, "Age", stringFormat = "{0} years old")
        self.View <- layout

type MyPage(viewmodel: obj) as self =
    inherit ContentPage(Title = "ListView sample")

    let listView = 
        new ListView(ItemTemplate = new DataTemplate(fun () -> box <| new MyTextCell()))

    do
        self.BindingContext <- viewmodel
        listView.SetBinding(ListView.ItemsSourceProperty, "List")
        self.Content <- listView
```

__Notice that when I implemented my own ViewCell, I specified the bindings within the Cell type therefore there was no need to specify the bindings via `listView.ItemTemplate.SetBinding`__.

### Dynamic lists

The previous sample was using a static list in the sense that the list never changes.
If the list needs to be updated and reflected in the UI, you can make the viewmodel inherit from `ViewModelBase` and notify that the list has changed every time.
But if you need to support add, remove, replace or move items, there is an implementation of a collection which already implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` which publish an events when actions are performed on its underlying list - `ObservableCollection`.

If we need a list which changes and where the View needs to be updated
Use `ObservableCollection<_>` to bind a list which automatically updates the views on `Add` and `Remove`

The `add` will be beside the `ListView` and `remove` will be on each `ViewCell`.
The actions are bound using `Command`'s, we will see next what it is.

```
type MyTextCell() as self =
    inherit ViewCell()

    let name = new Label()
    let age = new Label()
    let delete = new Button(Text = "Remove")
    let layout =
        let layout = new StackLayout(Orientation = StackOrientation.Horizontal)
        layout.Children.Add(name)
        layout.Children.Add(age)
        layout.Children.Add(delete)
        layout

    do
        name.SetBinding(Label.TextProperty, "Name", stringFormat = "{0},")
        age.SetBinding(Label.TextProperty, "Age", stringFormat = "{0} years old")

        delete.SetBinding(Button.CommandProperty, "Remove")
        delete.SetBinding(Button.CommandParameterProperty, ".")

        self.View <- layout

type MyPage(viewmodel: obj) as self =
    inherit ContentPage(Title = "Observable collection sample")

    let listView = new ListView(ItemTemplate = new DataTemplate(typeof<MyTextCell>))
    let btn      = new Button(Text = "Add new")

    let layout =
        let layout = new StackLayout()
        layout.Children.Add(listView)
        layout.Children.Add(btn)
        layout

    do
        self.BindingContext <- viewmodel
        listView.SetBinding(ListView.ItemsSourceProperty, "List")
        btn.SetBinding(Button.CommandProperty, "Add")
        self.Content <- layout
```

`"."` is used to bind the context itself.
We added a button to `remove` a person and `add` a new person.
For the definition of the viewodel, since we have added a `Remove` action on the cell itself, we will need to create a viewmodel for each cell which we'll call `PersonViewModel`.

```
type MyPageViewModel() as self =

    let list =
        new ObservableCollection<PersonViewModel>(
            [ { Name = "Greg"; Age = 29 }
              { Name = "Tom"; Age = 13 }
              { Name = "Sam"; Age = 5 } ]
            |> List.map(fun p -> new PersonViewModel(self, p.Name, p.Age)))

    member self.List
        with get() =
            list

    member self.Add
        with get() =
            new Command(fun () -> list.Add(new PersonViewModel(self, "New person", 0)))
    
and PersonViewModel(parent: MyPageViewModel, name, age) =
    inherit ViewModelBase()

    let mutable name = name
    let mutable age = age

    member self.Name
        with get() = name
        and set value = 
            name <- value
            base.OnPropertyChanged "Name"

    member self.Age
        with get() = age
        and set value = 
            age <- value
            base.OnPropertyChanged "Name"

    member self.Remove
        with get() =
            new Command<PersonViewModel>(fun p -> parent.List.Remove p |> ignore)
    
    new(parent:MyPageViewModel) = 
        new PersonViewModel(parent, "", 0)
```

Thanks to the `ObservableCollection`, after adding using `list.Add(...)` or removing using `list.Remove(...)`, the view is directly notified, __we don't need to call OnPropertyChanged manually__.
In this sample, we used `Command` to bind commands to the add button click event and remove button click event.
Let's see how they can be used.

__Trick: to access the list held in the parent viewmodel,__
__I am passing the parent viewmodel `MyPageViewModel` to the child viewmodels `PersonViewModel`.__
__That way I can acess the list from the child and remove item from the list.__

## 3. Commands

A command is used to bind functions to events such as clicked events or tapped events.
Xamarin provides an implementation of `ICommand` which simplifies the creation of commands by taking either an action or a function with a single argument.

```
...In viewmodel...
member self.MyCommand
    with get() =
        new Command(fun () -> 
            //do something
            ())

...In view...
btn.SetBinding(Button.CommandProperty, "MyCommand")
```

When `btn` is clicked, the function given to `new Command()` will be called.
It is also possible to pass an argument via `CommandArgument`.

```
...In viewmodel...
member self.MyCommand
    with get() =
        new Command<string>(fun str -> 
            //do something
            ())

...In view...
btn.SetBinding(Button.CommandProperty, "MyCommand")
btn.SetBinding(Button.CommandParameterProperty, "SomeString")
```

## Conclusion

Today we saw how we can implement data bindings to bind UI element properties for Label, button and lists.
We also saw how we can use Commands to bind actions in response to click events.
Data bindings allows us to separate the view and viewmodel.
By keeping the views and viewmodels independent, the code becomes more flexible and both can be changed independently.
