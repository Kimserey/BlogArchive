# Tree structure in Angular with PrimeNg

PrimeNg is a Angular component library. Compared to other component libraries like ngbootstrap or material, PrimeNg comes with more advance components which can't be found elsewhere, one of them being the tree structure.
Having the component is one thing but having to build the tree data which can be used by the component is another hard part.
Therefore today I will firstly show how we can use PrimeNg and secondly I will show how we can mold data to fit in the model used to build PrimeNg tree.
This post will be composed by 2 parts:

```
1. Install PrimeNg
2. Mold data for Tree structure
