# A better command prompt experience for Windows with ConEmu

When developing multiple Web api under multiple Visual Studio solutions, it can become very tedious to maintain, run and debug. Opening multiple instances of Visual Studio is very costly in term of memory and running all at once also clutter the screen which rapidly becomes irritating. With the advent of dotnet CLI tools, it has been clear that the next step would be to move out of the common "right click/build, F5" of Visual Studio and toward "dotnet run" on a command prompt.
Last month I was looking for a Windows alternative of the bash terminal which can be found on Mac and I found __ConEmu__.

__ConEmu__ provides access to all typical shells via an enhanced UI. It is actively maintained and open sourced [https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu). Today we will see how we can use __ConEmu__ to ease our development process by leveraging only 2 of its features; the tasks and environment setup. This post will be composed by 3 parts:

```
1. ConEmu overview

## 1. ConEmu overview

We can start first by getting ConEmu from the repository releases [https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases](https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/releases).

## 2. Setup tasks

## 3. Setup environment
