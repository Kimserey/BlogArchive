# The philosophy

- the context is everything
- the context in term of application is represented by the state
- top to bottom interaction from state to view
- state stores the data needed to be displayed
- only one context is set inside the store   

# The context onion layers

- page is a meaningful composition
- Layouts
- Containers
- Components

# The devil is in the details

- ensure proper initialization of the context
- guards
- routes

# The advent of the reactive movement

- async pipe
- rxjs
- ngrx
- state changes propagation

# Redux in Angular with ngrx store

- action
- reducer
- selector
- effects

# Structure of an application

- no redundant types
- structure
- order of typescript imports
- order of Angular declarations and imports in module
- barrel
- naming convention

# Specificities

- form handling with reactive forms
- inline validation
- update with json patch
- environments
- serving assets
- extensions

# Stack

- VSCode
- Typescript
- Angular CLI
