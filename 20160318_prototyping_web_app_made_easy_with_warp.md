# Prototyping web app made easy with WebSharper.Warp

Scripting quick prototypes in WebSharper can sometimes be troublesome. 
If for each prototype, a new project has to be created or code needs to be commented/uncommented, it can become quite demotivating as too many steps are required.
In F#, `.fsx` files are a great tool to script disposable code.
Write some isolated functions, run on FSI and then forget about it.

With WebSharper, it is possible to __script a complete sitelets__ in `.fsx` files using `WebSharper.Warp` [https://github.com/intellifactory/websharper.warp](https://github.com/intellifactory/websharper.warp).

In this post, I will show you how you can setup a project in order to use `Warp` efficiently to create sitelet prototypes.
Building with `.fsx` is a __huge__ advantage. It allows us to have multiple files containing completely isolated sitelets all within the same project.
Using one line command, we can boot up a sitelet to test it quickly which makes it ideal for prototyping.

The code here can be found on Github [https://github.com/Kimserey/WarpTemplate](https://github.com/Kimserey/WarpTemplate).

## Get WebSharper.Warp

There are two ways to get `WebSharper.Warp`. The first way is through Nuget and the second way is through Paket.

__For anything related to `.fsx`, I would strongly recommend using Paket.__

If you are unfamiliar with Paket you can read the [doc here](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/) or [checkout an older post I made about it](http://kimsereyblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/quick-setup-with-paket-and-fsx-scripts.html).
So we will be using Paket here.

Run the Paket command:
```
tools\paket.exe add nuget WebSharper.Warp
```

This should install `Warp` in your `\packages` folder. It should also install all the references of `Warp` including `WebSharper`, `WebSharper.UI.Next` and others.
`Warp` also comes with an extra folder `\tools` where you should find `reference-nover.fsx`. 
This file contains all the reference links to be loaded from your `.fsx` file so that you don't need to reference everything by yourself.
You just need to load `reference-nover.fsx` at the head of your `.fsx`:
```
#I "../packages/"
#load "WebSharper.Warp/tools/reference-nover.fsx"
```

_This is one of the reason why I recommended to use Paket. If we were to use Nuget, the path would break each time `WebSharper` is updated because Nuget puts the version number in the path._
_Another reason is that we don't need to add the reference to any project. We just need the libraries to be downloaded in order for us to reference it from our .fsx._

For the moment, some references are missing from `reference-nover.fsx`, [I've made a PR](https://github.com/intellifactory/websharper.warp/pull/18).
Until this is merged, you will need to alter `reference-nover.fsx` to add `WebSharper.UI.Next.Templating.dll` and `Intellifactory.Xml.dll` if you want to use the html templates in your sitelets.

Now that we have `Warp` ready, we can start creating our first sitelet.

## Build a sitelet

Let's start by creating a very simple sitelet.
Create a `.fsx` file and put the following sitelet in:

```
#I "../packages/"
#load "WebSharper.Warp/tools/reference-nover.fsx"

open WebSharper
open WebSharper.JavaScript
open WebSharper.Sitelets
open WebSharper.UI.Next
open WebSharper.UI.Next.Html
open WebSharper.UI.Next.Client

module Remoting =
    [<Rpc>]
    let sayHello() = 
        async.Return "Hello!"

[<JavaScript>]
module Client =
    let main() =
        View.Const ()
        |> View.MapAsync Remoting.sayHello
        |> Doc.BindView text

module Server =
    let site =
        Application.SinglePage (fun _-> 
            Content.Page [ client <@ Client.main() @> ])


do Warp.RunAndWaitForInput Server.site |> ignore
```

To create the sitelet, we use `Application.SinglePage` which is a helper to boot SPA with a single endpoint.

The interesting part is `Warp.RunAndWaitForInput` which takes our sitelet as argument.
If you run this code in FSI, it will boot a selfhosted server on `http://localhost:9000/` (by default).

This is fantastic! With just one single small isolated `.fsx` file we can boot a complete server and start serving pages. We could use another function than `Application.SinglePage` and have a full-blown sitelet with multiple endpoints if we wanted.


Now sending code to FSI is useful when we want to run part of the `.fsx` but in our case right now, we just evaluate the complete `.fsx` every time.
So to make this task easier, we can create a `buildAndRun.cmd` file which will execute the script so that we can easily restart the sitelet without having to manually sent the code to the FSI.
It consists of one single command line.

```
C:\"Program Files (x86)"\"Microsoft SDKs"\F#\4.0\Framework\v4.0\fsi.exe %*
```

And we run this command in the command prompt:
```
buildAndRun.cmd Simple_Sitelet.fsx
```

This was a simple example. But we can have more complex sitelets. For example, we can also reference external resources.

Say we want to add Bootstrap, one way to do it is by using the __html template__.

_Remember you need to add the libraries in reference-nover.fsx_

We can create a html file `index.html` which loads Bootstrap and place it at the root:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>-</title>
    <meta name="generator" content="websharper" data-replace="scripts" />
    <link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1q8mTJOASx8j1Au+a5WDVnPi2lkFfwwEAa8hDDdjZlpLegxhjVME1fgjWPGmkzs7" crossorigin="anonymous" />
    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-0mSbJDEHialfmuBBQP6A4Qrprq5OVfW37PRR3j5ELqxss1yVqOtnepnHVP9aJ7xS" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div data-replace="body">
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

And then use it as template with our sitelet:

```
module Server =

    type Page = { Body: Doc list }

    let template =
        Content.Template<Page>(__SOURCE_DIRECTORY__ + "/index.html")
            .With("body", fun x -> x.Body)
    
    let site =
        Application.SinglePage (fun _ ->
            Content.WithTemplate template
                { Body = [ client <@ Client.main() @> ] })
```

We now have all the ingredients to create powerful sitelet within a `.fsx` file:
 - RPCs
 - External resources
 - JS compilation
 - Boot on Owin selfhost

## Benefits

The major benefit is that it makes prototyping much easier. 
When I started to use WebSharper, I used to create new projects each time I had to test something.

It was slow and demotivating. I just kept the same project and every time I had to test something, I would delete the previous code.

Now I don't do that anymore as with `WebSharper.Warp`, only one `.fsx` file needs to be created. It is easy and quick and you can be up and running a full sitelet in a matter of seconds.
This makes prototyping much more enjoyable and combined with the build script, it is quick and easy to iterate.

## Conclusion

Today we saw how we could use `WebSharper.Warp` in a very efficient way. 
Prototyping is one of the best way to take advantage of `Warp` since it is so easy to get started!
I hope you will try it and let me know if you have other tricks to make your journey with `WebSharper` even more enjoyable.
