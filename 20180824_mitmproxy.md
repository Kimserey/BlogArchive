# Inspect proxied requests ffrom Nginx to Kestrel

In previous blog posts, we saw [how to proxy requests to an ASP NET Core application using Nginx](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/2018/06/asp-net-core-with-nginx.html). We saw that request headers also can be proxied with `proxy_set_header` In order to ease development, we need to be able to debug the values to verify that they are what we expect.
Today we will see two methods to inspect the proxied requests. This post will be composed by two parts:

1. Nginx location routing
2. Nginx variable debugging
3. Nginx proxied request debug with Mitmproxy

## 1 Nginx location routing

Considering the following configuration of our server:

```txt
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000; 
    }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5001/; 
    }
}
```

If we want to check whether our location routes are properly configured, we can short circuit the proxy_pass with `return` and use `curl` to check whether the location is properly selected.

```txt
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        return 200 "location '/'";
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000; 
    }

    location /api/ {
        return 200 "location '/api/'";
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5001/; 
    }
}
```

When we use `curl`, we can check wheter our locations are hit as expected.

```txt
> curl http://localhost/test
location '/'

> curl http://localhost/api/test
location '/api/'
```

## 2. Nginx variable debugging

[http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html](http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html)

Nginx also provides a set of variable which can be found in the [documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html). Some of the common ones are `$host`, `$request_uri` or `$scheme`.

To check the values of those variables at runtime, we can use the same `return` method as in 1) by adding the token in the text.

```txt
location / {
    return 200 "location '/' $scheme $host $request_uri $uri";
}
```

Then using `curl`:

```txt
> curl localhost/test
location '/' http localhost /test /test
```

## 3. Nginx proxied request debug with Mitmproxy

### 3.1 Proxy browser requests

[Mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) is command line proxy which can be used to inspect traffic coming in and out of it.
In the previous parts, we saw how to debug the location routing and how to display the variables from Nginx. In this last part we will see how we can intercept the requests proxied by Nginx to our underlying process like Kestrel for ASPNET Core.

To do that we start by downloading the binaries from the release notes of Mitmproxy on Github and extract it.

```sh
> wget https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/releases/download/v4.0.1/mitmproxy-4.0.1-linux.tar.gz 
> tar -xvzf mitmproxy-4.0.1-linux.tar.gz
```

This will yield 3 binaries `mitmproxy`, `mitmdump` and `mitmweb`. Here we are interested in `mitmproxy` which is the CLI proxy. Once it is extracted, make sure to set it as executable and execut it:

```
./mitmproxy
```

This will start `mitmproxy`. If we host an application on `http://localhost:5000` and wish to proxy request from the browser, we can set it up in the proxy settings in Chrome.

![proxy_setting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimserey/BlogArchive/master/img/20180824_mitmproxy/1_proxy_settings.PNG)

When we navigate to `http://localhost:5000`, the call will be proxied through `mitmproxy` and will be displayed on the CLI.

![mitmproxy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimserey/BlogArchive/master/img/20180824_mitmproxy/2_proxy_settings.PNG)

If our underlying host is serving on HTTPS with a self signed SSL certificate, common in develoment, we will hit the following error:

> 502 Bad Gateway
> Certificate verification error for localhost: self signed certificate (errno: 18, depth: 0)

This is due to the upstream certificate not being trusted.
To fix that, we can add `ssl_verify_upstream_trusted_ca: [path]` to the options of `mitmproxy`. The options are specified in the `.mitmproxy/config.yaml` file. [The options list is available on the official documentation](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-options/).
Add the option with the physical path of the certificate.

```txt
ssl_verify_upstream_trusted_ca: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

Here we gave the path of the locally trusted root certificates.

### 3.2 Proxy Nginx requests

So far we have seen how to proxy through `mitmproxy` but what we are more interested in for this post is how to proxy through `mitmproxy` from Nginx to Kestrel rather than from Browser to Nginx. In order to do so, we need to place `mitmproxy` between Nginx and Kestrel by setting it up as __a reverse proxy__.

This can be achieved using the `mode: reverse:[host]` option. We change our `config.yaml` to include the reverse proxy mode.

```txt
ssl_verify_upstream_trusted_ca: /mnt/c/ssl/localhost.crt
mode: reverse:https://localhost:5001
```

As we can see, we specify that what traffic comes into `mitmproxy` will be proxied to `https://localhost:5001`. And lastly we configure the `location` `proxy_pass` on Nginx configuration to proxy to `mitmproxy`:

```txt
location / {
    proxy_pass https://localhost:8080;
}
```

From there we should now be able to inspect the content of the request proxied by Nginx to Kestrel.

For example here is a full Nginx configuration with a self signed SSL certificate:

```txt
server {
    listen 80
    
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

    location / {
            include /etc/nginx/proxy_params;

            proxy_set_header X-Hello-World HelloWorld;
            
            proxy_pass https://localhost:5001;
    }
}
```

Note that we have added a test `proxy_set_header X-Hello-World`, to be able to see whether the header is properly set, we start `mitmproxy` and change the `proxy_pass`:

```sh
# proxy_pass https://localhost:5001;
proxy_pass https://localhost:8080;
```

And we should now see the header coming out in `mitmproxy`:

And that conclude today's post!
