# OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect and Identity Server

When it comes to authentication and authorization, the most used standard is OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect.
Few weeks ago I discussed [Resource owner password](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.sg/2017/04/resourceownerpassword-with-identity.html) and [Implicit](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.sg/2017/09/implicit-flow-with-identity-server-and.html) flows focusing mainly on implementations with Identity Server. Today I will give more insights on what is OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are and how Identity Server relates to them.

## 1. What is OAuth 2.0

[OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) is an authorization protocol enabling applications to have a limited access to protected resources. The authentication and authorization is handled in the Identity provider (Idp) who is in charge of delivering a bearer access token to client apppication after having authenticated the resource owner, usually the user.

In a concrete example, I have an application which you are a user from. When you log in, I want to get your profile picture from Facebook to display it on my application. The straight forward approach would be for my application to ask your Facebook username and password and to log into your Facebook. 
But this will cause many problems, the first one being that you would give your credentials to a third party (my application) and you wouldn't know what I will be doing with it. 
The second problem is that I will have full access to your account, there is no way for you to restrict the access to only the profile picture. Lastly it would be hard to revoke access, the only way would be to change your password. 
This is where OAuth 2.0 comes into picture by providing a way to delegate access to resources. Facebook implements the OAuth 2.0 protocol which allows my application to redirect you to the official Facebook site for you to login, hence your credentials would only transit in Facebook servers, and get an access token allowing me to access the resources your granted my applicaction to access. 

It makes the delegation possible via different flows. The flows are Authorization code, Implicit, Client credentials and Resource owner password flows.

- __Authorization code__ is used for clients who can keep a secret between themselves and the idp like hosted frontend.
- __Implicit flow__ is used for pure frontend clients like SPA who can't keep a secret.
- __Client credentials__ is used when the client needs to authenticate as itself, for example when your own application needs access to your own protected resource.
- __Resource owner password__ is used when the client is trusted. Be very cautious with this flow as the user credentials will need to be given to the client for the client to pass it to the idp.

OAuth 2.0 protocol also defines how clients are registered and how the flows occurs with the exchange on defined HTTP endpoints and when the access token is exchanged. But what it does not define is how to identify the user requesting the access.
A common practice used to be to return a second token signed by the identity provider, deserializable by the receipient containing the identifier of the user. But because the identification of the actual owner of the resource was not defined, every company providing external login had to create their own way and we now have a full list of OAuth 2.0 external provider.
Then came OpenID Connect.

## 2. What is OpenID Connect

OAuth 2.0 being so flexible, it allowed the authentication protocol, OpenID Connect, to be built on top of it.
OpenID Connect standardizes the way to identify the user by providing an `id_token` together with the OAuth access_token.

> OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0.

What it means is that OpenID Connect standardized the delivery of the `id_token` __within the existing flows of OAuth 2.0__.

The good thing is that it is standardized therefore it is possible to adopt an identity as a service model by providing our identity implementation to external application just like how it is possible to use external identity providers for our own applications.

## 3. What is Identity Server

Identity Server is a framework implementing OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect in the .NET ecosystem, and particularly for ASP .NET Core.

In previous blog post I have covered two flow implementations:
- [Implicit](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.sg/2017/09/implicit-flow-with-identity-server-and.html)
- [Resource owner password](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.sg/2017/04/resourceownerpassword-with-identity.html)

But all the flows are actually supported and there are examples backing up the flows on the github of identity server.

[https://github.com/identityserver](https://github.com/identityserver)

The project is totally open sourced and extremely well maintained and is OpenID certified.

__Identity server does not manage users__

A common misconception is to think that Identity Server implementation manages users. The responsability to store users information together with credentials is delegated to us. But there are helpers which binds common implementation of membership systems like ASP .NET Core Identity.

# Conclusion

Today we saw what was OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. We also decypher some of the misconceptions around authorization versus authentication and lastly we saw a .NET implementation of it, Identity Server. Hope this post was helpful! See you next time!
