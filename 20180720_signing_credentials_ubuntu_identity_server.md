# SelfSigned Certificate for Identity Server 4 and SSL in Ubuntu 16.04 server

To sign our JWT tokens, Identity Server 4 requires a signing credential. Today we will see how we can create our own key and provide it to Identity Server to be used as signing credential.

1. Configure ASP NET Core
2. Create key with `openssl`
3. Selfsigned certificate for local SSL usage 

If you are new to Identity Server, you can have a look at my previous blog post on [How to configure a Implicit authentication with Identity Server](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/2017/09/implicit-flow-with-identity-server-and.html?m=1).

## 1. Configure ASP NET Core

We start first by creating an extension on top of the `IIdentityServerBuilder` which when the key is available, will load our own key using the `.AddSigningCredential()` else will create a temporary key for development purposes,  `.AddDeveloperSigningCredential()`. 

```c#
public static class IdentityServerBuilderExtensions
{
    public static IIdentityServerBuilder LoadSigningCredentialFrom(this IIdentityServerBuilder builder, string path)
    {
        if (!string.IsNullOrEmptyString(path))
        {
            builder.AddSigningCredential(new X509Certificate2(path));
        }
        else
        {
            builder.AddDeveloperSigningCredential();
        }

        return builder;
    }
}
```

Using the configuration `appsettings.production.json`, we add a `signingCredential` section.

```json
"certificates": {
    "signing": "/etc/myapp/myapp.pfx"
}
```

We did not add the section in the `appsettings.development.json` therefore it will be `null` in development which is what we want for Identity Server to use the temporary key. Next we use the extension in the `Startup.cs` where we configured Identity Server:

```c#
var identityServerBuilder = services
    .AddIdentityServer()
    .LoadSigningCredentialFrom(Configuration["certificates:signing"])
    .AddInMemoryIdentityResources(...)
    .AddInMemoryApiResources(...)
    .AddInMemoryClients(...)
    .AddAspNetIdentity<ApplicationUser>();
```

Now that we are loading the key from a physical path, we can create the key.

## 2. Create key with `openssl`

To generate the key we will be using `openssl` on Ubuntu 16.04. We start firt by generating the private key `myapp.key` and public certificate `myapp.crt`:

```sh
sudo openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout myapp.key -out myapp.crt -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/CN=myapp" 
```

We name `.key` and `.crt` to follow the convention used in `ssl` for certificates which can be found under `/etc/ssl/(private|certs)`. Next we combine them into a key `myapp.pfx` usable by `dotnet`:

```sh
openssl pkcs12 -export -out myapp.pfx -inkey myapp.key -in myapp.crt -name "Some friendly name"
```

The resulting `.pfx` is the file which can be used to instantiate a `X509Certificate2` object we needed in 1).

If we already have a .pfx and want to extract the private key `myapp.key` and public key `myapp.crt`:

```sh
openssl pkcs12 -in key.pfx -nocerts -out myapp.key -nodes
openssl pkcs12 -in key.pfx -nokeys -out myapp.crt
``` 

## 3. Selfsigned certificate for local SSL usage 

Just like how we created a key to be used for signing credentials, it is possible to use `openssl` to create selfsigned certificate to be used for SSL.

```sh
sudo openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost"
openssl pkcs12 -export -out localhost.pfx -inkey localhost.key -in localhost.crt -name "Localhost selfsigned certificate"
```

```c#        
public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .UseKestrel(opts =>
        {
            var configuration = opts.ApplicationServices.GetService<IConfiguration>();
            opts.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 5000);
            opts.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 5001, listenOptions =>
            {
                listenOptions.UseHttps(
                    new X509Certificate2(configuration["certificate:ssl"])
                );
            });
        })
        .UseStartup<Startup>();
```

Before starting the application, we can install the certificate in our Trusted Root Certification Authorities which would allow the computer to recognize the certificate when delivered by the webserver. This can be done by opening the `.pfx` file and follow the wizard to install under `Trusted Root Certification Authorities`.

![install cert]()

Once installed, we run the application, we face the following issue:

![common name invalid]()

__Our certificate isn't trusted even though we imported it into the trusted certificates.__ This is due to the fact that we did not specified a __Subject Alternate Name__. Comparing our certificate to the certificate from ASPNET Core, we can see that we are missing the subject alternate name:

![aspnet core]()

_More information [here](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/m/#!topic/security-dev/IGT2fLJrAeo). Chrome has dropped the verification of domain name using "Subject" in favor of "Subject Alternate Name" which was dropped few versions ago by Mozilla too._

One problem is that `openssl` does not provide options on its CLI to set the subject alternate name. The way to do it is to provide a configuration using `-config`

```sh
cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ~/ssl-selfsigned.cnf
```

Under `[ v3_ca ]`, add the following `subjectAltName=DNS:localhost`at the end:

```txt
[ v3_ca ]
... some configs ...
subjectAltName=DNS:localhost
```

`v3_ca` is the section used to configure `x509` extensions as we can find further up the config:

```
[ req ]
... some configs ...
x509_extensions = v3_ca
```

And `[ req ]` is the command we use to create a new `x509` certificate. Once the file has been updated with the `subjectAltName`, we can generate the certificate using the same commands as we saw earlier and specify the config `-config ssl-selsigned.cnf`.

```sh
sudo openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ssl-selfsigned.key -out ssl-selfsigned.crt -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/CN=localhost" -config ssl-selfsigned.cnf
```

When we display the content of the cert, we should see the ` X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: DNS:localhost` at the end of the `X509v3 extensions` section.

```sh
openssl x509 -in localhost-selfsigned.crt -noout -text
```

Lastly we export this key and import it into our certificate manager and use it for our SSL connection.

```sh
sudo openssl pkcs12 -export -out ~/ssl.pfx -inkey ssl-selfsigned.key -in ssl-selfsigned.crt -name "Localhost Selfsigned"
```

Now when we navigate to `https://localhost:5001`, Chrome will be able to validate the certificate and provide that indication that the connection is secured using our selfsigned certificate.

And this concludes today's post.

## Conclusion

Today we saw how we could register our own key to be used to sign our tokens delivered by Identity Server. We started by configuring Identity Server to use the key if we pass the path to it else use a development key. We create a key using `openssl` for both signing credential and another key following the same method for SSL selfsigned certificate. Hope you liked this post, see you next time!
