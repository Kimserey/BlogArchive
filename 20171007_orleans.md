# Understand Microsoft Orleans warnings and errors

Microsoft Orleans is a framework which helps in building a distributed system by taking care of availability and concurrency for us. Even though it abstracts all the distributed system problems, there are instances where errors arize without us, developers, understanding what is going on. Lucky us, the logs is well documented... for those who can decrypt it. Today I will go through some of the errors and warnings which can be seen from the Silo and the Client. The code used to produce those errors can be found on my GitHub [https://github.com/Kimserey/orleans-cluster-consul](https://github.com/Kimserey/orleans-cluster-consul). Enjoy!

## 1. Can't find implementation of interface

```
An unhandled exception occurred while processing the request.

OrleansException: Cannot find an invoker for interface GrainInterfaces.IGrainTwo (ID=610902580,0x2469A234).
```

Missing grain lib reference or missing code generator.

## 2. Target silo became unavailable

```
An unhandled exception occurred while processing the request.

SiloUnavailableException: The target silo became unavailable for message: Request *cli/71849695@18418ea8->S127.0.0.1:40222:244531487TypeManagerId@S00000011 #10: global::Orleans.Runtime.IClusterTypeManager:GetClusterTypeCodeMap(). Target History is: <S127.0.0.1:40222:244531487:TypeManagerId:@S00000011>. See https://aka.ms/orleans-troubleshooting for troubleshooting help.
```

The grain resides in Silo 40222 but it is down and is not stated as dead in the membership table therefore the client see it as alive and tries to communicate but fails.
When there is only 1 silo, it is not possible to recover from this scenario.
With 2 silos, the second silo will mark the first one as dead which will make the client aware of the changes and therefore the client will update its own list of alive gateway and request the grain to be spawn in another alive silo

## 3. No gateway

```
An unhandled exception occurred while processing the request.

OrleansException: Could not find any gateway in Orleans.Runtime.Host.ConsulBasedMembershipTable. Orleans client cannot initialize.
```

There is no silo alive in the cluster, therefore the client cannot find any gateway to communicate with.

If there are silos available, it should appear in the list of live gateway list. This check occurs every minute. The list contains all proxy gateway addresses to access the silos:

## 4. Logs

Logs on client appears with address `{ip}:0`.
Logs on silo appears with `{ip}:{port}`

### 4.1 Silo restart on same address

```

The silo detects that it has restarted and deprecate  

Client message gateway when silo goes down:
