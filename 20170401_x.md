All you need to know about the cost of living in London

In 2015, I decided to relocate from Singapore to London. At the time I had no idea about the cost of living, the places where renting would be nice and where to buy groceries. Fast forward to few weeks ago, March 2017, I moved back from London to Singapore for professional reasons. But while I was in UK, I kept an extremely close look to every in and out from my bank account. Today I would like to share what I wish someone would have shared before I made a move. This post will be composed by 6 parts:

1. Our situation
2. Recurring expenses
3. Rent a place
4. Bills
5. Grocery shopping
6. Leisure

1. Our situation

Before starting to dive into the cost of living, your situation will certainly be different than ours but I believe some of the expenses will still remain similar.
My fiancee and I lived in a one bedroom apartment. The apartment was located at Pontoon Dock on the east of Canary Wharf with access to the DLR but not the underground.
We were working from home and didn't need to take transport everyday.
We mostly ate home lunch and dinner with occasional dinner at restaurants.
I will be discussing cost as a couple in total. Even though your situation will be different, I am very sure that some expenses will be similar if you are planning to relocate as a couple or even single.

2. Recurring expenses

My overall rent + bills expense in total was 1500 GBP per month - rent was at 1250 GBP and all bills added to 250 GBP.
Living with my fiancee, we mostly ate at home. Our average monthly groceries spending was of 450 GBP. I was working from everyday so our transport spending was limited to going to buy groceries which adds up as a monthly expense to about 100GBP for two. 

Those recurring expenses add up to 2050GBP which HAD to be spent in order to live.

3. Rent a place

We found our apartment with Foxtons. We had a lot of issues in finding an apprennent to rent as we did not have any credit history. Any rent is subject to credit check. Failing credit check would result in a rejection from landlords.
There are multiple places where you can find a rent. Agencies like Foxtons have a lot of apartments and choices but you will be subject to agent fees. 

I am not sure about having a direct contract with landlord.

Our apartment was located in Pontoon Dock. The rent was at 1250 pcm with a deposit of 2,5 months. Usual deposits go up to 1,5 months but in our case, with no rent history, we had to negotiate with the landlord to give her a higher security in exchange of her trust.

Side note: our deposit was refunded within three weeks after we vacated the property without any issues.

4. Bills

The bills to consider were the gas and electricity, the council tax, mobile phones and internet.

Gas and electricty was about 50 GBP per month for two persons. 
The council tax was of 110 GBP. This tax will depend on which area you will live in.
For mobile phones we used Giffgaff. Giffgaff is by far the best option for mobile plans, we were having a package of 500mb of data for 7.5GBP per month with unlimited call to other Giffgaff numbers. 500mb was enough for us as we stayed home most of the time.
Lastly for internet, we used Hyperoptic with a 20gb connection for 31 GBP per month.

Those were the expenses:

5. Groceries

For groceries, we used to buy groceries from Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsburry and Asda.

Living in Pontoon Dock, we could access to Tesco at Woolwich arsenal via DLR.
For Waitrose and Sainsburry, they are both located at Stratford which we could access via DLR. Lastly we used Asda for home delivery to deliver heavy items like water bottles.

As mentioned earlier, our spending per month in supermarket average around 450 GBP.

6. Leisures
