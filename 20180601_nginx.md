# ASP NET Core with Nginx

Few weeks ago I showed how to host ASP NET Core on Windows Server behind IIS. Compared to Windows Server, Ubuntu with nginx offers a quicker way to get started and a better control over the kestrel process.
Today we will see how to host an ASP NET Core application on Ubuntu. This post will be composed of three parts:

1. Install nginx
2. Configure nginx

## 1. Install nginx

Start by installing nginx.

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```

After installing nginx, the daemon should have been installed and started. We should be able to navigate to `http://localhost` and see the nginx default page.
This page is the default root folder of nginx which can be found under `/var/www/html/`.

We should also be able to interact with it just like any other daemon managed by `systemd`:

```sh
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

And similarly it can be debugged via `journald`:

```sh
sudo journalctl -xeu nginx
```

_If you aren't familiar with systemd, you can read my previous blog post on how to [Manage Kestrel process with systemd]()_.

## 2. Configure nginx reverse proxy

Nginx is configured using configuration files known as `sites`. There are multiple sections for configuring different functionalities, here we will only explore `server` and `location`.

The default configuration of the server can be found under the sites available `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`. This is the default created with runs the index page from nginx.

In order to enable a site, it needs to be in the `sites-enable`. This is achieved by creating a symlink, if we navigate to `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`, we can find the symlink of `default`.

```txt
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name myapp.com www.myapp.com;

    include /etc/nginx/proxy_params;

    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

    location / { }

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/;
    }
}
```

```sh
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp /etc/nginx/sites-enable/myapp
```
