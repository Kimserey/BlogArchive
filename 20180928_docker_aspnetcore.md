# Deploy ASP NET Core application on Docker Linux container from Windows

Few weeks ago we saw how we could run [ASP NET Core application on Ubuntu](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/2018/06/asp-net-core-with-nginx.html). This proving that a .NET Core Application can run on a Linux system, today we will be taking it a step further and see how we can deploy our application in a Docker Linux container. This post will be composed by three parts:

1. Install Docker on Windows
2. Docker basic commands
3. Create ASP NET Core application

## 1. Install Docker on Windows

The first step is to go to the [official site, sign up and download Docker CE](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).
Once downloaded, install Docker.

After being installed you should be able to right click on the icon > Settings on the Docker notification icon and see that Docker is running by checking the status at the bottom left, it should say `Docker is running`.

Open `PowerShell` and type `docker run hello-world`.

```
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
d1725b59e92d: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:0add3ace90ecb4adbf7777e9aacf18357296e799f81cabc9fde470971e499788
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
```

You just downloaded the `hello-world` image and ran it in a container which printed `Hello from Docker` which was redirected to the console.

### Fix Docker not starting:

 - Check that Hypervisor is enabled by opening the `Windows Features` and check if every checkbox is selected under `Hyper-V`.

- Next Under Hyper-V Manager check that `MobyLinuxVM` is in `Running` state.

- If it isn't running, Docker fails to start, virtualization might not be enable on your computer and you will have to enable it on BIOS.

## 2. Docker basic commands

Now that Docker is installed and we can start build images and running containers, we can look into some of the terminology and [commands from the CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).

An image is a set of layers describe by the `Dockerfile`. It represents a state of an environment. It is built with `docker build`. There can be multiple version of the image tagged to different versions. A container is a running instance of an image bootup using `docker run`. Multiple containers can be started from the same image.

To manage image and containers, we can use the commnad `docker image ...` and `docker container ...`.

For example to list all the containers running:

```
docker container ls
```

Or to see all images:

```
docker image ls
```

A container can be seen as a running process, it can be stopped using the following command:

```
docker container stop [container-id]
```

Or killed:

```
docker container kill [container-id]
```

Rogue images and containers can be cleared with `prune`:

```
docker image/container prune
```

Images and containers can be removed using `rm` with 

```
docker image/container rm [image or container id]
```

Lastly standard output are redirected and can be viewed using:

```
docker container logs [container-id]
```

Now that we have Docker installed, and know some functionalities of the `docker CLI`, let's see how we can setup an ASP NET Core application running in Docker Linux container.

## 3. Create ASP NET Core application

In order to get an ASP NET Core application running on Docker, we need to create a `Dockerfile` which is a file containing instruction on how to build a Docker image of our application.

### 3.1 Dockerfile


Start by creating an empty ASP NET Core application. Then create the following Docker file:


```
FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime AS base
WORKDIR /app

FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY DockerWebApp/DockerWebApp.csproj DockerWebApp/
RUN dotnet restore DockerWebApp/DockerWebApp.csproj
COPY . .

WORKDIR /src/DockerWebApp
RUN dotnet build DockerWebApp.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish DockerWebApp.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "DockerWebApp.dll"]
```

The Dockerfile contains multiple step, `FROM` specifies the image from you will start, `WORKDIR` specifies the current dictory within the container. `COPY` is used to copy files and `RUN` is used to run processes. At the end of the script we defines the `ENTRYPOINT` as being the dotnet process with the dll as argument just like we would run `dotnet DockerWebApp.dll` in our command prompt.

One we have the Dockerfile, we can build by running the following in the root of the application:

```
docker build -f DockerWebApp\Dockerfile -t dockertest:dev .\
```

`docker build` builds the image, `-f` specifies the dockerfile paht while `-t` represents the name of the repository and the tag of the application. We can see the image built with `docker image ls`.

```
$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY                                TAG                      IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
dockertest                                dev                      6663b809a99a        4 seconds ago       255MB

```

Once built we can run this image by mapping the port of the container to 5000 on the local machine.

```
docker run -p 5000:80 dockertest:dev
```

If we look at the list of containers, we will see our container runnning and the `PORTS` specifies that the local machine redirects traffic from 5000 to 80 in the container.

```
docker container ls
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
a7ab376d75ab        dockertest:dev      "dotnet DockerWebAppâ€¦"   32 seconds ago      Up 30 seconds       0.0.0.0:5000->80/tcp   cocky_montalcini
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` and you will be able to hit your application running in Docker container.

```
$ docker container logs -f a7ab376d75ab
