# How to setup Continuous Integration/Deployment with GitLab for ASP NET Core application

Continuous integration "CI" and continous deployment "CD" (and continous delivery) environments are important to setup to remove respectively the pain of pushing code and risking breaking your master branch and having to manually deploy your application each time you need to either test it or deliver it.
Today we will see how we can setup CI/CD by leveraging the free services from GitLab.
This post will be composed by 4 parts:

```
1. Overview of the scenario
2. Setup a runner
3. Configure your job
4. Monitor your deployment on GitLab
```

## 1. Overview of the scenario

I am assuming that your application is pushed to GitLab.

My scenario is the most simplistic one may have:

 1. I want to setup continuous integration, meaning build and running test and detect break in my code at each push on master branch.
 2. I want to deploy on my own local computer (as example, in real life this could be deploying to your VM).

The result will be as followed:

```
At every push on master branch, the code will be built, the tests ran, the application published and my application will be accessible with the new changes.
```

In order to setup the flow, only two steps are required:

 1. Install the GitLab runner
 2. Configure the .gitlab-ci.yml file

We will see next how to do so.

## 2. Setup the runner

There are three keywords important; runner, job and task:

 1. A __runner__ is a program which runs jobs.
 2. A __job__ is a set of instructions, like a task, which are executed under certain conditions.

With a runner configured, we can setup an automation process for CI/CD by creating a __pipeline__ composed of multiple jobs where the first job will build our application, the second one will run all our tests then the third and last one will publish the application. 

In order to configure the runner, for me it was on Windows, I followed the instruction from gitlab:

1. Create a folder for example `C:\GitLab-Runner`
2. Download the binaries [https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html)
3. Resgiter the runner [https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html#windows](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/index.html#windows) - Make sure you copy the token from `Settings > CI/CD > Runners settings > Specific Runners`.
4. Install the runner as a Windows service 

Once you completed this steps, you should have a fully functional runner read to accept jobs!

## 3. Configure your job

Next what we need to do is to create a job by adding a `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of our application.

```
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
  
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - dotnet build
  tags:
    - default

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - dotnet test
  tags:
    - default

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - C:\Scripts\Publish.cmd
  environment:
    name: staging
  only:
    - master
  tags:
    - default
```

The pipeline will be composed by 3 jobs. `stages` defines the stage which categorized the jobs and allow similar jobs to run simultaneously. In this small samples, we don't need to run multiple jobs concurrently therefore we have 3 stages and 1 job per stage.
Here are code under the `script` section of each task is running using command line. This has been set in the runner configuration and can be seen in the toml configuration file `executor = "shell"`.
For the first `build task`, we run `dotnet build` which is the default way of buidling ASP NET Core application using the dotnet CLI.
Next in the `test task`, we run `dotnet test` which will run all our test.
And lastly the `deploy task` will run a script file which I have place locally on my machine at a define path.

The content of my `Publish.cmd` is as followed:

```
@echo off
cls

set APP="WebApplication1"
set DIST_PATH="C:\Distribution\Test"
set FULL_PATH="C:\Distribution\Test\WebApplication1.exe"

IF EXIST %DIST_PATH% (
	sc stop %APP%
) ELSE (
	mkdir %DIST_PATH%
	sc create %APP% binPath=%FULL_PATH%
)

dotnet publish -c release -o %DIST_PATH%
sc start %APP%
```

A very simple command line script which check if the application has been deployed already, if it hasn't, it will create the path and create a Windows service targeting the ASP NET Core application then will publish using `dotnet publish` and specifying the output path as the distrubtion path which the Windows service run. Then complete by starting the Windows service.

_Of course I am assume that the ASP NET Core application runs as a Windows service. This can easily be configured using the library `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WindowsServices` and following the tutorial on the official documentation [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/hosting/windows-service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/hosting/windows-service)._

## 4. Monitor your deployment on GitLab

Now that we have our runner setup and we have the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file configured, after that we push our application to master, we can visualize the pipeline on GitLab CI/CD section.

![pipeline]()

The pipeline allows to see the job execution as consecutive steps and in which steps the deployment failed. At each steps, we will see a failure sign with a red cross where we can check logs for more details directly from GitLab UI.
Each step is actually a job and the list of all the jobs ever ran for your repository can be seen in the list of jobs.

![jobs]()

This can allow us to quickly pin point where a problem sits. Lastly, we can also see the environments we have and which application is currently deployed under that environement.

And that's it, we have setup all the tools required and we now know how to debug in case of errors, we now have a complete solution CI/CD and we are able to manage from GitLab UI any aspect of the integration and deployment!
