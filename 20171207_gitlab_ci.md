# How to setup Continuous Integration/Deployment with GitLab

Continuous integration "CI" and continous deployment "CD" (and continous delivery) environments are important to setup to remove respectively the pain of pushing code and risking breaking your master branch and having to manually deploy your application each time you need to either test it or deliver it.
Today we will see how we can setup CI/CD by leveraging the free services from GitLab.
This post will be composed by 3 parts:

```
1. Overview of the scenario
2. Setup a runner
3. Configure your jobs
```

## 1. Overview of the scenario

I am assuming that your application is pushed to GitLab.

My scenario is the most simplistic one may have:

 1. I want to setup continuous integration, meaning build and running test and detect break in my code at each push on master branch.
 2. I want to deploy on my own local computer (as example, in real life this could be deploying to your VM).

The result will be as followed:

```
At every push on master branch, the code will be built, the tests ran, the application published and my application will be accessible with the new changes.
```

In order to setup the flow, only two steps are required:

 1. Install the GitLab runner
 2. Configure the .gitlab-ci.yml file

We will see next how to do so.

## 2. Setup the runner

The runner is the program which runs your jobs.
