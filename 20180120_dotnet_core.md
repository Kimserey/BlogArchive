# DotNet Framework Standard Core and ASPDotNet

A lot of things have changed from the past few years with the DotNet ecosystem. In many occasions, I have seen myself explaning the differences between DotNet Core and DotNet Standard but more precisely the difference between DotNet Framework application, DotNet Standard libraries and how do they all relate to ASP Net Core.
So many variant and buzz words that it is quite confusing to first look at.
So today, I would like to take another approach and dive into each one of them by explaining the differences, not in term of keyword but in term of project template. What is the difference between DotNet Standard library or DotNet Core library, what is the difference between DotNet Core application or DotNet Framework application, etc... This post will contain 6 points:

```
1. DotNet Standard library
2. DotNet Core library
3. DotNet application
4. DotNet framework application
5. ASP Net MVC
6. ASP Net Core
