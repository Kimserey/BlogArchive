Import RouteModule and Routes

Define routes and import RouteModule.forRoot(routes)

Component is displayed after router-outlet

RouterLink can take array
Bind one time routerLink=x or dynamic [routerLink]=x

RouterLinkActive=active
Active is the class used on the element when active.

Route are relative paths

Path: ''
RedirectTo: '/my-page'
PathMatch: 'full'

Means if the whole path matches it will redirect.

PathMatching sets the router route identification behaviour.

There are two types prefix and full. Prefix being the default we only need to specify when we want the matching to be full.
