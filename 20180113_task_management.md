# Managing product delivery and day to day operations

I have worked as a Software Engineer for a decade. Have gone through many managements, different countries, different companies, different projects, ultimately leaving me with a bitter taste, a taste of unaccomplishment.
After few years of reflection, I came to realize that half of the feeling came from my inexperience and immaturity. On the other hand, the other half was meant to be fulfilled by the management under which I was working, including line managers, higher management, directors and company.
It is incredibly hard to find the right process to get a Software Engineering team to work well. Most of the challenges aren't well understood by those coming from different backgrounds. Not that it is harder or easier, it is just different. Tasks aren't easily measured, it is hard to make KPI, goals aren't easily defined and set, and many more issues. We have seen that giving management responsabilities to someone without a Software Engineer background can be challenging, if not harmful. In all companies I worked for, the management was actually a Sales unit in disguised. But we also seen the opposite, whereby giving management responsabilities to a Software Engineer by elevating her as leader can be equally harmful. Not all of us are equipped with the tools and mentality to manage more individuals then just ourselves.

Last year, I was placed in this exact situation. I came from a Software Engineer background and was given the chance to lead a team of Software Engineers. This was my chance to make a difference. I took what I felt as an engineer and the damages done by management as lessons to understand the chain of events which yielded the present result to figure out what had to change. I was determined to find a better way of managing a team, a middle ground for a higher efficiency, valuable for both, the project and the individuals. I was determined to find a better way of working but for it to happen, I had to make changes, changes in my own work and changes in the process employed. What follows is the explanation of those changes that I applied to myself and to my team, including changes of responsabilities, changes of mentality, and of course changes in the process. This post will be composed by three parts:

```
1. Mentality and personality
2. Resonsabilities
3. Process
```

## 1. Mentality and personality

Switching position from Software Engineer to a managerial position comes with new challenges. As a Software Engineer I used to be focused solely on completing task at hand. Getting a task or a feature up to match requirements, awaiting for my dose of recognition after I completed my work. Even though I always deeply cared about everyone, I used to be focused on myself. How I could do the work efficiently and at the end get my piece of the cake.
It was a selfish mindset coming from immaturity. I would criticize processes for hindering me from achieving, and at time even criticize people for not being able to deliver.   

Strong mind, critisms
Maturity
Vision

## 2. Resonsabilities

The first responsability is in regards to the image delivered. 
Punctual
Wiseness
Empower
Ensure guidance
Listener

## 3. Process

Find the balance between too much freedom and too much guidance. Each team has a different level where it is comfortable.

Feature
Priority
Priority for the system
What is the most important for the application
Priority for specific events


Transparency
Always move forward with items to work on based on priority
Refinement to redefine the next iteration of work to be done.
Traceability
