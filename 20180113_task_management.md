# Managing product delivery and day to day operations

I have worked as a Software Engineer for a decade. Have gone through many managements, different countries, different companies, different projects, ultimately leaving me with a bitter taste, a taste of unaccomplishment.
After few years of reflection, I came to realize that half of the feeling came from my inexperience and immaturity. On the other hand, the other half was meant to be fulfilled by the management under which I was working, including line managers, higher management, directors and company.
It is incredibly hard to find the right process to get a Software Engineering team to work well. Most of the challenges aren't well understood by those coming from different backgrounds. Not that it is harder or easier, it is just different. Tasks aren't easily measured, it is hard to make KPI, goals aren't easily defined and set, and many more issues. We have seen that giving management responsabilities to someone without a Software Engineer background can be challenging, if not harmful. In all companies I worked for, the management was actually a Sales unit in disguised. But we also seen the opposite, whereby giving management responsabilities to a Software Engineer by elevating her as leader can be equally harmful. Not all of us are equipped with the tools and mentality to manage more individuals then just ourselves.

Last year, I was placed in this exact situation. I came from a Software Engineer background and was given the chance to lead a team of Software Engineers. This was my chance to make a difference. I took what I felt as an engineer and the damages done by management as lessons to understand the chain of events which yielded the present result to figure out what had to change. I was determined to find a better way of managing a team, a middle ground for a higher efficiency, valuable for both, the project by providing maximum accomplishment and the individuals by leaving each teammember valued. I was determined to find a better way of working but for it to happen, I had to make changes, changes in my own work and changes in the process employed. What follows is the explanation of those changes that I applied to myself and to my team, including changes of responsabilities, changes of mentality, and of course changes in the process.
