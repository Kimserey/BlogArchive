# The Steps Toward Leadership

I have worked as a Software Engineer for a decade. Have gone through many managements, different countries, different companies, different projects, ultimately leaving me with a bitter taste, a taste of unaccomplishment.
After few years of reflection, I came to realize that half of the feeling came from my inexperience and immaturity. On the other hand, the other half was meant to be fulfilled by the management under which I was working, including line managers, higher management, directors and company.
It is incredibly hard to find the right process to get a Software Engineering team to work well. Most of the challenges aren't well understood by those coming from different backgrounds. Not that it is harder or easier, it is just different. Tasks aren't easily measured, it is hard to make KPI, goals aren't easily defined and set, and many more issues. We have seen that giving management responsabilities to someone without a Software Engineer background can be challenging, if not harmful. In all companies I worked for, the management was actually a Sales unit in disguised. But we also seen the opposite, whereby giving management responsabilities to a Software Engineer by elevating her as leader can be equally harmful. Not all of us are equipped with the tools and mentality to manage more individuals then just ourselves.

Last year, I was placed in this exact situation. I came from a Software Engineer background and was given the chance to lead a team of Software Engineers. This was my chance to make a difference. I took what I felt as an engineer and the damages done by management as lessons to understand the chain of events which yielded the present result. I was determined to find a better way of managing a team, a middle ground for a higher efficiency, valuable for both, the project and the individuals. I was determined to find a better way of working but for it to happen, I had to make changes in my own way of thinking, changes in my behaviour and changes in my interaction with others. I went from a selfish mindset to a open and caring mindset, from only focusing on my personal task to focus toward a team and company goal, from viewing a short term development to projecting a long lasting future. All these changes were in fact part of one single change in my personality which I will call __The Steps Toward Leadership__. Today I would like to share those steps in three parts:

```
1. Misconceptions
2. Reality to pursue
3. Opportunity
```

## 1. Misconceptions
## 2. Reality to pursue
## 3. Opportunity


Having a strong mind is about sustaining the pain of difficult situations. Knowing when to think about long term plans to convert down situation to up situation. This will come with maturity. 
Understanding that problems are inheritent in all companies and projects and the world is in need of leaders.

Leaders are individuals who are able to empower those around them to achieve more.
Empowering includes teaching, providing help when needed while never being a bottleneck and the most important being becoming an inspiration for others to have a reference.
Becoming an inspiration comes with responsabilites as the leader will become the example therefore all the aspects of maturity need to be reflected, respect, punctuality, understanding  if you become the model for others, you have the responsability to act as such.

When we talk about leader we immediately think about Larry P., Mark Z., Elon M. or Jeff B. but in reality, leaders are everywhere. 
Becoming a leader isn't about putting a product to market or building a company. 
It isn't about staying late at the office
It isn't about being the loudest
It isn't about being right or wrong

Adopting a leader mindset isn't about being the besy
