# How does NgModule work in Angular

The first time I saw the NgModule decorator and its arguments I was completely lost. 
I couldn't understand what was the meaning of imports, declarations, exports, providers or bootstrap and I had a hard time finding clear explanations. 
So today I will go through each attributes and provide an explanation together with an example to understand what is the role of each NgModule argument.

```
1. How does a NgModule declaration look like?
2. Imports
3. Exports
4. Declarations
5. Providers
```

The full source code is available on my GitHub [https://github.com/Kimserey/ng-samples](https://github.com/Kimserey/ng-samples).

## 1. How does a NgModule declaration look like?

Angular utilises the typescript decorators to define `NgModule`.
It accepts `imports`, `declarations`, `exports` and `providers`.

A typical declaration would look like that:

```
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { SquareComponent } from './square.component';
import { SquareService } from './square.service';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: [
    SquareComponent
  ],
  exports: [
    SquareComponent
  ],
  providers: [
    SquareService
  ]
})
export class SquareModule { }
```

Here we are __importing__ the `CommonModule` from `@angular/common` to give access to common directives like `ngIf` or `ngFor`.
Then we are __declaring__ the `SquareComponent` which is a component defined by ourselves.
Then we are __exporting__ it, so that other modules who import `SquareModule` can use the `SquareComponent`.
Lastly we are __providing__ a service, `SquareService` which we have defined ourselves and make it avaible for dependency injection. 

## 2. Imports

`Imports` in NgModule is an array of module. Use it to import functionalities which other modules export.

## 3. Exports

`Exports` is an array of functionalities which the module exports.
A module can also re-export an entire loaded module which then export all the functionality of that module.

For example here in (1) we imported `CommonModule`. Now let say we had a `SharedModule` with common functionalities like so:

```
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { HighlightDirective } from './highlight.directive';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: [
    HighlightDirective
  ],
  exports: [
    HighlightDirective,
    CommonModule
  ]
})
export class SharedModule { }
```

Notice that we are exporting the `CommonModule`. By doing that, whoever is importing `SharedModule` will not need to import `CommonModule` as it will be imported thanks to `SharedModule`.

So we can change (1) to the following:

```
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    SharedModule
  ],
  declarations: [
    SquareComponent
  ],
  exports: [
    SquareComponent
  ],
  providers: [
    SquareService
  ]
})
export class SquareModule { }
```

This technique can be used to import & export multiple modules which are repeatedly imported in different modules.
It is also possible to re-export specific components, directives or pipes from imported module. This could be useful if you do not wish to re-export the whole functionalities of a module.

## 4. Declarations

`Declarations` is an array of either __components__, __directives__ or __pipes__.
They are classes defined in the module. They need to be `declared` to be usable within the module itself.

For example here we have defined `SquareComponent` in `SquareModule` and `HighlightDirective` in `SharedModule`.

Do not declare modules or services in the declarations.

## 5. Providers

`Providers` are used to provide services or connstants via dependecy injection.

_For dependency injection, more can be found in the [official documentation](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html#!#register-providers-ngmodule)._

In this example, we have defined a service which can be injected.

```
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable
export class SquareService {
  computeSurface = (side: number) => side * side;
}
```

Which we then register in the providers.

```
providers: [
    SquareService
]
```

This is a shortform the following registration:

```
{ provide: SquareService, useClass: SquareService }
```

Providers can be of the following types:

```
export declare type Provider = 
  TypeProvider 
  | ValueProvider 
  | ClassProvider 
  | ExistingProvider 
  | FactoryProvider 
  | any[];
```

### Provider alias

Instead of using the class, it is possible to provide a different alias to a provider.

```
{ provide: Service, useClass: Service2 }
```

This could be useful when we have a new service which will be replacing an old one but still have component referencing the old one.
If we want to be able to inject Service2 but need the same instance when injecting Service:

```
[ 
  Service2,
  { provide: Service, useExisting: service2 } 
]
```

### Value providers

We can also directly provide values.
This can be achieved using `useValue` instead of `useClass` which creates a `ValueProvider`. 

```
class Settings {
  apiUrl: string;
}

let settings = {
  apiUrl = "test";
}
```

We then register it the same way as other providers:

```
{ provide: Settings, useValue: settings }
```

### Factory providers

It is also possible to register a factory to provide services.
This can be used to provide computed values in the service constructor.

For example we could define the following factory:

```
let squareServiceFactory = (logger: Logger) => {
  return new SquareService(logger);
}
```

Then we can create a `FactoryProvider`:

```
export let squareServiceProvider = 
  { provide: SquareService,
    useFactory: squareServiceFactory,
    deps: [ Logger ] }
```

Notice the `deps` (dependencies) which is a list of provided dependencies.

Lastly we can register `squareServiceProvider` in our providers:

```
providers: [ squareServiceProvider ]
```

### InjectionToken

So far we have used classes to provide a service.
For `ValueProvider`, we provided the class to retrieve the value but in event where we don't have a class, for example if we have an interface, what can we do?
Interfaces are typescript invention. They help the compiler but when turned to JS, they are removed.
Therefore since the classes are used to figure out what service to provide, we need a way to register those values without classes.
That is what the `InjectionToken` is for.

```
import { InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';

export interface AppConfig {
  Test: string;
}

export let APP_CONFIG = new InjectionToken<AppConfig>('app.config');
```

Here we have an interface with a `Test` member. We can define a `InjectionToken` which we can then use to register the service.

```
providers: [{ provide: APP_CONFIG, useValue: { Test: 'Hello world' } }]
```

Lastly we ca then inject the value using the `InjectionToken` using the `@Inject()` decorator like so:

```
constructor(@Inject(APP_CONFIG) config: AppConfig) {
  this.title = config.title;
}
```

__Note:__ `app.config` is a description used for the string representation of the injection token.
We can see it in the [source code of Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/core/src/di/injection_token.ts):

```
toString(): string { return `InjectionToken ${this._desc}`; }
```

# Conclusion

Today we saw what NgModule are composed of. We seen what were the purpose of the imports, exports, declarations and providers.
We have also seen multiple way to provide services and values using the different type of provider.
