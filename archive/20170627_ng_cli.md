# Bootstrap your Angular project with Angular CLI

In order to facilitate the creation of a new Angular project, it is possible to use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). Angular CLI is a CLI providing functionality to bootstrap, upgrade and serve your Angular app. Today we will see how we can use Angular CLI to improve our workflow.

1. Bootstrap a new project
2. Creating new components
3. Serve the application

## 1. Bootstrap a new project

Start first by installing Angular CLI with the following command:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

After the installation, the cli should be available globally via the `ng` command. You can try it with `ng help`. To bootstrap a project, we use `ng new my-new-project`. We can also specify some options, here we specify that we want to skip the tests creation which is set to true by default, we want inline style and inline template.

```
ng new my-new-project --skip-tests --inline-style --inline-template
```

This creates the simplest Angular app. We have the main module `app.module.ts` and component `app.module.ts`.
In order to build the project we can use `ng build`.

## 2. Creating new components

AngularCLI also helps in creating all the boilerplate needed for creating components.

```
ng g my-component --flat -is -it 
```

Here we specify `-is` for inline style and `-it` for inline template both are short forms for `--inline-xxx`. Other than component, we can also use this command to create directives, services, pipes and guards.

## 3. Serve the application

We can then try out the app using `ng serve`. The app is served by default on localhost on the port 4200.

```
** NG Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200 **
```

Our application will run and the source code will be watched too therefore every changes in the code will provoke a recompilation and update of the browser.

# Conclusion

AngularCLI makes life easier for developing Angular application. It also handle test generation and execution which I haven't covered. A full list of command can be found by doing `ng help`. Hope you liked this post as much I enjoyed writing it. See you next time!
