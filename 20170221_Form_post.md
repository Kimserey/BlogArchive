# Post form data to server

When building websites, chances are that you will need to gather data from your users.
The most common way to gather data is via a form. But after gathering the data, there are two ways to submit it from the browser to your server:

 1. Using a HTML form
 2. Using an Ajax call

Today we will see the differences and how we can implement it.

## 1. Submit data using a form

Before hand, I have created a simple server which has a single endpoint accepting a POST.

```
type EndPoint =
| [<EndPoint "POST /upload">] Upload

let Main =
    Application.MultiPage (fun ctx -> function Upload -> Content.Text "Received")
```

Next we can create a simple form with one an input and button to submit.

```    
<form method="post" action="/upload">
    <input name="my-data" type="text" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

The `action` is the url to post to.
The `method` is the Http method.

When we press the submit, the form is submitted and we can see from Chrome that the data have been submitted using a POST and that the content type is x-www-form-urlencoded.

```
Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Form Data
my-data:test
```

Url encoded means that the content of the file has been _encoded in the url_ and posted to the action specified. This is the default behavior.

But if we need to send a file, we will not be able to url encode the file, we need to send it as `form-data`.
Let's start by adding a file input:

```    
<form method="post" action="/upload" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input name="my-data" type="text" />
    <input type="file" name="some-file" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

And to tell the browser to submit as form-data we need to specify the encoding type `enctype="multipart/form-data"`.
Now when we submit we can see that the data has been sent as multipart form data.
And __the content type also include__ `boundary=XXX` which __lets the server know the boundary delimiting the data in the body of the request__.

```
Content-Type:multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary23lA5KSmXMXrKcOe

Request payload:
------WebKitFormBoundary23lA5KSmXMXrKcOe
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="my-data"

hello world
------WebKitFormBoundary23lA5KSmXMXrKcOe
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="some-file"; filename="Untitled.png"
Content-Type: image/png


------WebKitFormBoundary23lA5KSmXMXrKcOe--
```

And from the server side, we can see that we receive a file in the context request.

![file_request]()

_To prevent  going to a page showing the result of the POST, we can implement the POST-REDIRECT-GET logic (PRG)._

In the era of SPAs, lot of websites now do everything via JavaScript and Ajax in particular to submit data. Let's see how we can achieve that in JS.

## 2. Submit data using Ajax

Submitting data by Ajax allows to submit a json object which we can handle on our server.
To do that we can intercept the submission when the button is pressed and gather all data on submit and the Json object by specifying the content type as Application/json.

```
<form id="form">
    <input name="data-1" type="text" />
    <input name="data-2" type="text" />
    <button id="ajaxForm">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```
(function () {
    $("#ajaxForm").click(function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        var json = JSON.stringify($("#form").serializeArray());
        $.ajax({
            type: "post",
            url: "/upload",
            data: json,
            contentType: "application/json",
            success: function () { }
        });
    })
})()
```

Clicking on the submit button will invoke the click handle and submit data as `json`:

```
Content-Type:application/json

[{name: "data-1", value: "test1"}, {name: "data-2", value: "test2"}]
```

`serializeArray` is quite clever as it selects input with a `name` and the `value` assigned and place it into a serializable key value list.
[https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/](https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/)

If we need to submit a file here, we will not be able to use Json and same as previously, we wil need to use form data.

To do that we can build the form data using FormData and append.

```
<form id="form2">
    <input name="data-1" type="text" />
    <input name="data-2" type="text" />
    <input type="file" name="some-file" />
    <button id="ajaxFormFormData">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```
$("#ajaxFormFormData").click(function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();

    var form = $("#form2");
    var fd = new FormData();
    $.each(form.serializeArray(), function (index, val) {
        fd.append(val.name, val.value)
    });
    fd.append('file', form.children('input[type=file]')[0].files[0]);

    $.ajax({
        type: "post",
        url: "/upload",
        data: fd,
        contentType: false,
        processData: false,
        success: function () { }
    });
});
```

Here we append all the data and the files to the form data. Next we pass the form data to the Ajax post and __set the processData to false__ and __contentType to false__ - setting contentType to false will have the multipart content type and boundary automatically set for us.

Now when we submit the form, the content plus the files will be sent as `multipart/form-data`.

```
Content-Type:multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryTCQcqMA9mCM3QP5H

------WebKitFormBoundaryTCQcqMA9mCM3QP5H
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="data-1"

test
------WebKitFormBoundaryTCQcqMA9mCM3QP5H
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="data-2"

test
------WebKitFormBoundaryTCQcqMA9mCM3QP5H
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="my_image.png"
Content-Type: image/png
```

And that's it, those are the main ways we can submit data from the client to the server!

# Conclusion

Today we saw how we could submit data from the client to the server via a Http POST. We saw how we could do it using classic HTML forms then we learnt how we could do it straight from JavaScript with Ajax. We also learnt the different content type and how to use them.
