# Microsoft Orleans Grains (Microsoft Orleans Part 3)

Few weeks ago [I explained the benefits of using Microsoft Orleans](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.sg/2017/10/a-first-look-at-microsoft-orleans.html). One of them was the implementation of the actor pattern. Today I will dig deeper into it by revisiting a common scenario present in today systems and how it can be solved with Orleans grains.
This post will be composed by 3 parts:

```
1 - Traditional system
2 - Problem
3 - Grain solution
```

## 1. Database and locks

In a traditional system, we can often see a N-tier architecture (usually 3-tier) composed by the following:

```
Front end -> Service tier -> Database
```

The front end being the webserver like ASP NET. The service tier being a set of stateless services containing business logic. They ensure the consistency of the system by extracting the latest state of business object from the database, validate business rules and write back to database ~ the last tier. In this sort of architecture, the database is the source of truth.

This can be illustrated with the following example of a bank account with 4 rules:

```
1. The user can deposit and withdraw from a bank account.
2. Withdrawal is only permitted if the amount is higher or equal to the balance of the account.
3. Deposit is always allowed.
4. Only the owner can withdraw money.
```

```
class BankAccountService
{
    IStorage _storage;

    public BankAccount(IStorage storage)
    {
        _storage = storage;
    }

    public void SetOwner(Guid accountId, string ownerName)
    {
        var owner = _storage.GetOwner(accountId);
        owner.Name = ownerName;
        _storage.SaveOwner(owner);
    }

    public void Deposit(Guid accountId, decimal amount)
    {
        var bankAccount = _storage.GetBankAccount(accountId);
        bankAccount.Balance += amount;
        _storage.SaveBankAccount(bankAccount);
    }    

    public void Withdraw(Guid accountId, string ownerName, decimal amount)
    {
        var bankAccount = _storage.GetBankAccount(accountId);
        var owner = _storage.GetOwner(accountId);

        if (bankAccount.Balance < amount)
            throw new ValidationException("Amount withdrawn must be lower or equal to balance.");

        if (owner.Name != ownerName)
            throw new ValidationException("Only the owner is allowed to withdraw.");

        bankAccount.Balance -= amount;
        _storage.SaveBankAccount(bankAccount);
    }
}
```

Behind `IStorage`, the implementation fetch and write to the database.

The second business rule is ensured by doing the following:
1. The storage hits the db to get the latest status, 
2. then we ensure that there is enough money before we deduct the amount,
3. then save the account back to database

This service, even though stateless, has a major drawback, __it isn't thread safe__. Meaning this service is not guaranteed to yield predictable results if multiple threads call its functions concurrently.

## 2. The problem

Thread safety is one of the main problem modern system face. How can we allow our system to execute multiple queries while keeping a consistent output?

One easy scenario, starting from a zero balance, could be if `Deposit` happens slightly before `Withdraw`, but both run on different threads. There will be 2 possible results:
- Saving deposit amount happens before withdraw validation is done and the withdraw can be executed
- Withdraw validation happens before deposit therefore a validation exception is thrown

__Without thread safety, it is impossible to predicte the result of code.__

In order to bring back the consistency in the system, a concurrency control must be implemented.

When the resource is not frequently accessed or when it is not often that a the resource gets updated concurrently, an __Optimistic concurrency control__ can be employed.
__Optimistic concurrency__ assumes that the changes done on the resource do not happen frequently therefore instead of locking the resource, it tracks the values of the resource from the time it was read and at the moment of writing, checks if the resource has changed since. Depending on the way we handle the result, we can either overwrite the value or just abort the changes.

This works well for most scenarios where updates is not frequent. In the event of having frequent calls, say our  bank account had money withdrawn frequently. We would need to implement another concurrency control, pessimistic concurrency control. 

__Pessimistic concurrency control__ is used when frequent read and write to a resource are required. It is pessimistic in the sense that we assume the worse therefore lock the resource for each transaction. There are two type of locks read and write locks:

- Write lock are needed for read and write on a particular row, write lock means: `I will be changing this row so don't let others read this row until I finish updating it.`
- Read lock are needed to lock the the row for read, read lock means: `I need the data in this row to stay the same during my transaction so don't let anyone change it. But you can let others read if they need.`

In our example, we will need to implement a locking mechanism on all 3 functions, `SetOwner`, `Deposit` and `Withdraw`. In `withdraw` we will acquire a write lock on the bank account and a read lock on the owner. With that, we will ensure that no other thread can access the resource while it is in the current transaction.

The main problem with pessimistic concurrency is that it creates contention as locking is invovled. __The other main problem is that it is the responsability of the developer to create the complex logic around the locking mechanism__.

Therefore we can conclude that there are three major problems in a N-tier application:

1. the state of the application is stored in the database therefore for an update, two round trips are needed, one to fetch the latest state and a second one to write the state after update
2. the database is the source of truth which makes the system highly reliant on the data saved, the fetch is required to prevent validating business rules on stale data
3. the services contaning the business logic isn't thread safe which pushes us to implement a complex locking mechanism to handle multi threads
