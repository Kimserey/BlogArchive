# ASP NET Core Client-side libraries management with VS 2017 Library Manager

Few weeks ago I discussed how we could create a healthchek library which would return json status of our application. Using the json, I wanted to make a quick page to display healthchecks in a nice visual. I wanted to quickly add `Bootstrap` and `momentJS`. For frontend libraries, I was used to use Bower as it nicely put every frontend package in `/bower_components` which can be served as static data. But since Bower was announcing that it was no longer supported and requested to use Yarn or NPM, I started to look around for an easier solution than those as I don't really care about source code of the frontend libraries, all I want is the latest compiled versions. After few minutes of research, I found out that the team in Microsoft felt the same way as I did and already worked on a tool called `Library manager` (libman) and is available in `VS Preview` for the moment. Libman gives the benefit to allow developers to download locally the latest compiled version of the `CSS` or `JS` of their preferred frameworks for frontend usage. We can see Libman as a CDN file management for local usage. Today I will show how it can be used and combined with Razor pages to bring quickly pages to life. This post will be composed of three parts:

1. Enable Library Manager
2. Configure Bootstrap
3. Create a simple site with Razor pages

## 1. Enable Library Manager

__Before starting, make sure that you are on Visual Studio 2017 Preview 15.7.0.__

First thing to do is to right click on the project and select `Manage Client-Side Libraries`.

After that we have enabled it, we will have a `libman.json` file. Right click on the `libman.json` file then select `Restore on build`.

This will have as effect to download locally the libraries to the destination specified in the `libman.json`.

## 2. Configure Bootstrap

Now that we have Libman setup, we want to be able to use Bootstrap 4.1.0 for our website. To do that we would normally use CDN links:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" />

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.slim.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/popper.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
```

But thanks to Libman, we can download locally the libraries by configuring the `libman.json` file:

```json
{
  "defaultProvider": "cdnjs",
  "libraries": [
    {
      "library": "jquery@3.3.1",
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/jquery",
      "files": [
        "jquery.slim.min.js"
      ]
    },
    {
      "library": "popper.js@1.14.3",
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/popper.js",
      "files": [
        "umd/popper.min.js"
      ]
    },
    {
      "library": "twitter-bootstrap@4.1.1",
      "destination": "wwwroot/lib/bootstrap",
      "files": [
        "css/bootstrap.min.css",
        "js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

By setting the destination to `wwwroot/lib/xxx`, the package will be dowloaded to the `wwwroot` folder which is the default folder served by ASP NET Core static file.

## 3. Create a simple site with Razor pages

Razor pages work similarly as Razor views with the only difference that they are standalone and do not require controllers.

[Link to official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio)

### 3.1 Routes

Razor pages are placed in a `/Pages` folder and use folder structure to define their routes. For example:

```txt
- /Pages
 | - _Layout.cshtml
 | - _ViewImports.cshtml
 | - Index.cshtml
 | - Contact.cshtml
 | - /Projects
     | - Index.cshtml
     | - MyProject.cshtml
```

This folder structure will yield the following route tree:

```txt
/
/Contact
/Projects
/Projects/MyProject
```

### 3.2 Model

A Razor page can optionally define a model class which can handle `HEAD`, `GET` and `POST` by adding a function prefix by `on`. For example:

```c#
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public void OnGet()
    {
        // load the values
    }

    public IEnumerable<string> Values { get; set; }
}
```

This will get called automatically when the page is requested.
It is also possible to add extra `POST` handlers using the tag helper `asp-page-handler`:

```html
<button type="submit" asp-page-handler="test" asp-route-data="@somedata">Test</button>
```

And from the model class we have the handler:

```c#
public Task OnTestAsync()
{
    // do something
}
```

### 3.3 Layout, ViewImports and tag helpers

Just like Razor views, we have access to layouts, view imports and tag helpers.

_If you never seen Razor, you can have a look at my previous blog post on [Razor syntax and helpers](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.sg/2017/05/razor-syntax-and-helpers.html)._

We start by defining the `_ViewImports.cshtml` where we globally load all tag helpers:

```html
@addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
```

Next we create a common layout `_Layout.cshtml` for all pages.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>Libman</title>
    <environment names="Development">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css" />
    </environment>
    <environment names="Production">
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="~/lib/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" />
    </environment>
</head>
<body>
    @RenderBody()
    <environment names="Development">
        <script src="~/lib/jquery/jquery.slim.js"></script>
        <script src="~/lib/popper.js/umd/popper.js"></script>
        <script src="~/lib/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.js"></script>
    </environment>
    <environment names="Production">
        <script src="~/lib/jquery/jquery.slim.min.js"></script>
        <script src="~/lib/popper.js/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
        <script src="~/lib/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    </environment>
</body>
</html>
```

This layout loads the libraries and make use of the `environment` tag helper to load the minified version for `Production`.

Lastly every page can make use of the layout, for example here the index page `Index.cshtml`:

```html
@page
@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}

<h1 class="display-1">Welcome to Libman test.</h1>
<p>Hello world!</p>
```

When navigating to the site, we should now see our welcome message with Bootstrap style!

## Conclusion

Today we saw how to we could use Libman to manage client site libraries. We also saw how we could leverage Razor pages to start building a site using Razor. Hope you liked this post! See you next time!
