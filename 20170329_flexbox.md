# Create a navbar responsive display with flexbox and boostrap v4

Last week we saw how to setup vscode to compile sass. Today we will see how we can compile bootstrap sass files together with our own sass and define a grid layout for the collapsed nav in smaller screen using flexbox.

## 1. Flexbox

Flexbox allows to control how elements are rendered in a responsive layout.
We can control precisely how the space available is occupied by elements together with the order of appearance.
There's few settings for it which are applied to the container and the elements within the container.

Refer to MDN documentation if you want more explanation [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes).

In this tutorial, I will only use the following css properties:

__For the container:__

```
display: flex;
flex-flow: row wrap;
```

`display:flex` is used to specify that the display is a `flexbox` and the flexbox css properties apply to it.
`flex-flow` is a shorthand for `flex-direction flex-wrap`. `row` means that the direction is row, it could also be column/row-reverse/column-reverse. `wrap` means that the `flex-wrap` is `wrap`, the elements break into multiple lines, it can also be nowrap/wrap-reverse.

__And for the items:__

```
flex: 1 50%;
```

`flex` is a shorthand for `flex-grow flex-basis`. `flex-grow` defines how the element occupies the space available compared to other elements and `flex-basis` is the initial width of the element. In this example, `1 50%` means that `flex-grow` is 1 and `flex-basis` 50%.

Now that we know how to use flexboxes, we can 

## 2. Bootstrap sass media directive

In this example we will be using Bootstrap v4 nav and directives.
