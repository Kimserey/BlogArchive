# Create a navbar responsive display with flexbox and boostrap v4

Last week we saw how to setup vscode to compile sass. Today we will see how we can compile bootstrap sass files together with our own sass and define a grid layout for the collapsed nav in smaller screen using flexbox.

 1. Flexbox
 2. Bootstrap sass media directive
 3. Build the nav style

## 1. Flexbox

Flexbox allows to control how elements are rendered in a responsive layout.
We can control precisely how the space available is occupied by elements together with the order of appearance.
There's few settings for it which are applied to the container and the elements within the container.

Refer to MDN documentation if you want more explanation [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes).

In this tutorial, I will only use the following css properties:

__For the container:__

```
display: flex;
flex-flow: row wrap;
```

`display:flex` is used to specify that the display is a `flexbox` and the flexbox css properties apply to it.
`flex-flow` is a shorthand for `flex-direction flex-wrap`. `row` means that the direction is row, it could also be column/row-reverse/column-reverse. `wrap` means that the `flex-wrap` is `wrap`, the elements break into multiple lines, it can also be nowrap/wrap-reverse.

__And for the items:__

```
flex: 1 50%;
```

`flex` is a shorthand for `flex-grow flex-basis`. `flex-grow` defines how the element occupies the space available compared to other elements and `flex-basis` is the initial width of the element. In this example, `1 50%` means that `flex-grow` is 1 and `flex-basis` 50%.

Now that we know how to use flexboxes, we can 

## 2. Bootstrap sass media directive

`sm/md/lg` are commonly used in Bootstrap for responsive design. The navbar for example has a `navbar-toggleable-X` where `X` is one of the size breakpoint. It defines at which breakpoint does the nav become toggleable.
To leverage those breakpoints, we can directly use Bootstrap sass directives in our own sass. To do that we first start by getting the source code of boostrap v4:

```
bower install bootstrap#v4.0.0-alpha.6
```

Now that we have boostrap sass source files, we will be able to use the media query breakpoints via the sass mixins like so:

```
.my-class {
    /* default style up to sm */
    @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
        /* style from sm */
    }
}
```

Which will translate to the following media query:

```
.my-class {
    /* default style up to sm */
}
@media (min-width: 576px) { 
    .my-class {
        /* style from sm */
    }
}
```

## 3. Build the responsive navbar

Now that we know how flexboxes work and how to use Bootstrap mixins, we can build the responsive navbar we saw in the preview.

We start by the html:

```
<nav class="navbar navbar-toggleable-sm navbar-light bg-faded fixedsticky fixedtop">
    <button class="navbar-toggler navbar-toggler-left" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
        <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>

    <a href="#" class="hidden-md-up ml-auto"><img src="content/icon.png" class="brand-img" /></a>

    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
        <div class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
            <div class="navbar-nav-button">
                <img src="content/job_sign.png" class="brand-img" />
                <br/>
                <a class="" href="#">Jobs</a>
            </div>
            <div class="navbar-nav-button">
                <img src="content/office_building.png" class="brand-img" />
                <br/>
                <a class="" href="#">Companies</a>
            </div>
            <div class="navbar-nav-button">
                <img src="content/job_seeker_portrait.png" class="brand-img" />
                <br/>
                <a class="" href="#">User profile</a>
            </div>
            <div class="navbar-nav-button">
                <img src="content/star.png" class="brand-img" />
                <br/>
                <a class="" href="#">Saved</a>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</nav>
```

Notice that we have a brand icon which gets hidden when higher than md thanks to `hidden-md-up`.
For the nav menu, we set it as `navbar-toggleable-sm` meaning it toggle on small screen `sm`.
`navbar-nav-button` is a custom style which we are going to define now:

```
.navbar-nav {
    flex-flow: row wrap;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 400px;
    margin: auto;

    .navbar-nav-button {
        flex: 1 50%;
        text-align: center;
        padding: .5em;

        @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
            flex: 1 auto;
            padding: 0;
        }
    }

    @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
        max-width: 600px;
        margin: 0;
    }
}
```

`navbar-nav` is the css class styling the toggleable menu. By default the flow is `row` and when toggled becomes `column`.
In our example, we have same size icon buttons therefore having all the buttons in a column could be a waste of space and having those in a 2x2 grid would be better. In order to do that we force the flow to remain `row` 
Bootstrap nav is by default `display:flex`, therefore we do not need to specify it.
