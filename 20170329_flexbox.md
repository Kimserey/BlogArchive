# Create a navbar responsive display with flexbox and boostrap v4

Last week we saw how to setup vscode to compile sass. Today we will see how we can compile bootstrap sass files together with our own sass and define a grid layout for the collapsed nav in smaller screen using flexbox.

```
1. Flexbox
2. Bootstrap sass media directive
3. Use it
```

## 1. Flexbox

Flexbox is a display which allows us to control how elements will be rendered in a responsive layout.
We can control precisely how the space available is occupied by elements together with the order of appearance.

Display: flex
