# Progressive Web App with Angular

Progressive Web App allows an Angular website to be installed locally and be available on the app drawer and on the home screen of a phone. Today we will see how to use Angular Progressive Web App module to transform our app into a mobile app. This post is composed by two parts:

1. Install @angular/pwa
2. Configure service worker
3. Service worker in action

## 1. Install @angular/pwa

To install the progressive web app package we use `ng` CLI in the root of the project:

```
ng add @angular/pwa
```

`pwa` stands for progressive web app. It will install `@angular/pwa` and `@angular/service-worker`. 
The progressive web app comes with a default `manifest.json` created at the `src` of the project which defines the icon, the color theme and boundries of the app in regards to the website. For example this is a `manifest.json` generated for `My App`:

```
{
  "name": "My App",
  "short_name": "My App",
  "theme_color": "#1976d2",
  "background_color": "#fafafa",
  "display": "standalone",
  "scope": "/",
  "start_url": "/",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "assets/icons/icon-72x72.png",
      "sizes": "72x72",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "assets/icons/icon-96x96.png",
      "sizes": "96x96",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "assets/icons/icon-128x128.png",
      "sizes": "128x128",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "assets/icons/icon-144x144.png",
      "sizes": "144x144",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "assets/icons/icon-152x152.png",
      "sizes": "152x152",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "assets/icons/icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "assets/icons/icon-384x384.png",
      "sizes": "384x384",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "assets/icons/icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

We can see that it defines the following properties:
 - the `name`, `short_name` and `icons` defines the look on the app drawer, the splashscreen and the popup to add to home screen for the app,
 - the `theme_color` defines the color used to tint the UI elements on mobile, it will define the tint of the address bar and the notification bar. `theme_color` defined in `index.html` will overwrite the one defined in `manifest.json`,
 - the `scope` defines the url scope of the progressive web app and where it should break back out to browser, here our whole website is meant to act as an app therefore the scope is the root `/`,
 - the `start_url` defines the path where the app should start on when launched,
 - the `display` defines how the browser UI displays the app - here `standalone` indicates that it should look and feel like a native app,
 - the `background_color` defines the background color used on the splashscreen.

[The full documentation can be found on Google documentation.](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/)

It should also be automatically added to the assests in `angular.json` under `build` and `test` architects.

To make sure that our manifest is found, we can run the application and look into the chrome debugger > Application section, we should be able to see our settings:

![manifest]()

## 2. Configure service worker

As we saw in 1), installing `@angular/pwa` with `ng` CLI also installed `@angular/service-worker`. A service worker brings offline capabilities to a web application. It can be viewed as a caching layer for HTTP methods. `@angular/service-worker` provides an abstraction over service worker which would normally be coded in Javascript. It allows us to configure the caching mechanism via a Json file called `ngsw-config.json` which can be found at the root of the project. Installing the package also registered the `ServiceWorkerModule` in the `AppModule`:

```
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    ...
    ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: environment.production })
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

`environment.production` points to the default environment settings which is a boolean `true` when building for production with `ng build --prod`. The service worker will only be enabled for production. `ngsw-worker.js` is the default service worker script used which comes in `@angular/service-worker` package.

It also automatically add a configuration in production under the `build` architect for `"serviceWorker": true` in `angular.json` which will setuo Angular CLI to build the application augmented with service worker. We can leave the `angular.json` setting to `true` and when we need to disable service worker, we can set `{ enabled: false }` on the module registration which will make the application act as if service worker was not supported by the browser.

Lastly it also added the `ngsw-config.json` at the root:

```
{
  "index": "/index.html",
  "assetGroups": [
    {
      "name": "app",
      "installMode": "prefetch",
      "resources": {
        "files": [
          "/favicon.ico",
          "/index.html",
          "/*.css",
          "/*.js"
        ]
      }
    }, {
      "name": "assets",
      "installMode": "lazy",
      "updateMode": "prefetch",
      "resources": {
        "files": [
          "/assets/**"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `ngsw-config` sets the caching policies for the service worker. It is composed by five properties, here is the typescript interface which the json deserialize to:

```
export interface Config {
    appData?: {};
    index: string;
    assetGroups?: AssetGroup[];
    dataGroups?: DataGroup[];
    navigationUrls?: string[];
}
```

- `appData` is an object that can be used to store any data which will be available in the [`UpdateAvailableEvent`](https://angular.io/api/service-worker/UpdateAvailableEvent) and [`UpdateActivatedEvent`](https://angular.io/api/service-worker/UpdateActivatedEvent) from the `SwUpdate` service.
- `index` defines the index page which will be use for navigation.
- `assetGroups` defines the caching for the assets in the application, by default it defines two groups - the files composing the application and the static resources. `installMode` defines how the resources are being downloaded on installation and `updateMode` defines how the resources are being updated when they have changed. `prefetch` would download them as soon as changes were made while `lazy` would download them on demand as they are requested.
- `dataGroups` defines the caching for data related requests, like API requests.

The difference between `assetGroups` and `dataGroups` is that assets compose the application and each asset is versioned with a hash key. Any change in those files will yield a different hash which will indicate to service worker that the version of the app changed and one of the file needs to be downloaded. `dataGroups` on the other end represent the data which are separated from the application version. But on their own, data have a `version` as well which can be used to maintain compatibility between app version and data version for situation where upgrade of API aren't backward compatible.

In our example, our app has API calls to `/api/persons` and `/api/companies` therefore we need to define those as `dataGroups`:

```
{
  "index": "/index.html",
  "assetGroups": [
    {
      "name": "app",
      "installMode": "prefetch",
      "resources": {
        "files": [
          "/favicon.ico",
          "/manifest.json",
          "/index.html",
          "/*.css",
          "/*.js"
        ]
      }
    }, {
      "name": "assets",
      "installMode": "lazy",
      "updateMode": "prefetch",
      "resources": {
        "files": [
          "/assets/**"
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "dataGroups": [
    {
      "name": "api",
      "urls": [ "/api/**" ],
      "cacheConfig": {
        "maxSize": 100,
        "maxAge": "1m"
      }
    }
  ] 
}
```

Here our API and webapp are both hosted under the same domain therefore it is necessary to define the `dataGroups`, when browsing `mysite.com/api/persons`, the service worker will kick in and forward the route to the Angular router which will fail as no such route exists.
We are now done with setting up the service worker. To be able to test it, we need to build in prod:

```
ng build --prod
http-server dist\service-worker-test
```

We use `http-server` to host locally our `dist` folder containing the production build of our app.

## 3. Service worker in action

In action, the file dictating how the browser should act is the `ngsw-config.json`. It is downloaded every time the app is launched or the website is opened.

![ngsw]()

_As a side note, we can see that the default behavior for assets is `installMode: lazy/updateMode: prefetch` and for the application is `installModle: prefetch/updateMode: prefetch`. We can also see the hash generated in the `hashTable` property._

And for the API calls, we can see that when a request to `/api/persons` is made, it is first `fetched` and subsequent calls are instantly returned from the service worker. After a minute as we set, another fetch will occur.

![person]()

When the application updates, once relauched, the new version will be updated as the behavior for the application is `prefetch`.

## Conclusion

Today we saw how we could setup our Angular application to become a Progressive Web App, we started by looking at how we can install the packages needed on Angular using the angular CLI. Then we moved on to configuring a `manifest.json` which sets look and feel for the application, then we moved on to configuring the behavior of the service worker which provides offline capabilities and lastly we saw how the service worker acts on the browser itself. Hope you liked this post, see you on the next one!
