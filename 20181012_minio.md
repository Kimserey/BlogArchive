# Minio blob storage

Minio is a open source distriubted storage. Few weeks ago, I showed how we could use it to [store Microsoft Orleans actor states by implementing a grain storage backed with Minio](). Today we will see how we can install two parts of Minio, the Minio server and the Minio client and we can update it when need be.

1. Install and manage Minio on Ubuntu
2. Minio content with `mc`

## 1. Install and manage Minio on Ubuntu

[https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html)

To install Minio, we follow the [instructions from Minio](https://www.minio.io/downloads.html#download-server-linux-x64) to install the server:

```
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://dl.minio.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
chmod +x minio
```

We installed minio in `/usr/local/bin` in order to allow users to run and made it executable. 
Now have minio installed locally and can start it using the `server` command:

```
minio server --config-dir /etc/minio /var/minio/data
```

This will start Minio server and place the TLS configuration for secure communication in `/etc/minio` while placing blob data in `/var/minio/data`.

To update Minio, we simply need to run the following and follow the CLI instructions:

```
minio update
```

In order to have Minio running as a service, we can create a systemd Unit under `/etc/systemd/system/minio.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Minio
Documentation=https://docs.minio.io
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin
User=minio-user
Group=minio-user
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/minio server --config-dir /etc/minio /var/minio/data

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And run the following:

```
systemctl enable minio
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start minio
```

Now that we've seen how to install the server, we can install the client.

## 2. Minio content with `mc`

[https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide)

The client allows us to query blobs from command line. To install it, we follow [the instructions from Minio](https://www.minio.io/downloads.html#download-client).

```
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://dl.minio.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc
chmod +x mc
```

We now have the client installed locally and we can configure the host. When 

```
mc config host add myminio http://[minio_ip]:9000 [access_key] [secret_key]
```

After having configured the host, we can use `mc` to navigate on our storage just like any filesystem.

```
mc ls myminio
```

To update `mc`, we check for new update by using the following command:

```
mc update
```

Then if an update is available, we remove the old `mc` binary and download the new one.

## Conclusion

Today we saw how to install and update Minio server and Minio client. We also saw how we could setup Minio server to run as a daemon with systemd. Hope you like this post, see you next time!
