# Minio blob storage

Minio is a open source distriubted storage. Few weeks ago, I showed how we could use it to [store Microsoft Orleans actor states by implementing a grain storage backed with Minio](). Today we will see how we can install two parts of Minio, the Minio server and the Minio client and we can update it when need be.

1. Install and manage Minio on Ubuntu
2. Minio content with `mc`

## 1. Install and manage Minio on Ubuntu

To install Minio, we follow the [instructions from Minio](https://www.minio.io/downloads.html#download-server-linux-x64) to install the server:

```
cd /usr/local/bin
wget https://dl.minio.io/server/minio/release/linux-amd64/minio
chmod +x minio
```

We installed minio in `/usr/local/bin` in order to allow users to run and made it executable. 
Now have minio installed locally and can start it using the `server` command:

```
minio server --config-dir /etc/minio /var/minio/data
```

This will start Minio server and place the TLS configuration for secure communication in `/etc/minio` while placing blob data in `/var/minio/data`.

To update Minio, we simply need to run the following and follow the CLI instructions:

```
minio update
```

In order to have Minio running as a service, we can create a systemd Unit under `/etc/systemd/system/minio.service`:

```
[Unit]
Description=Minio
Documentation=https://docs.minio.io
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin
User=minio-user
Group=minio-user
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/minio server --config-dir /etc/minio /var/minio/data

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And run the following:

```
systemctl enable minio
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start minio
```

## 2. Minio content with `mc`

check with `mc update`

wget https://dl.minio.io/client/mc/release/linux-amd64/mc
chmod +x mc
./mc --help
