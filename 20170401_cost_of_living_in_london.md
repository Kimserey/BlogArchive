# Cost of living in London

In 2015, I decided to relocate from Singapore to London. At the time I had no idea about the cost of living, the places where I should rent and places where the groceries would be the cheapest. 

Fast forward to today, March 2017, I moved back from London to Singapore. I stayed around London for more than a year and a half and while I was there, I kept an extremely close look to every in and out from my bank account. 

Today I would like to share what I wish someone would have shared before I relocated, __a post about cost of living in London__. This post will be composed by 6 parts:

```
1. Situation
2. Recurring expenses
3. Rent a place
4. Bills
5. Grocery shopping
6. Leisure
```

# 1. Situation

My fiancee and I lived in a one bedroom apartment. The apartment was located at Pontoon Dock on the east of Canary Wharf with access to the DLR (but not the underground). It is about 40min by DLR+underground from Bank station.
I was working from home and didn't need to take transport everyday.
We mostly ate home lunch and dinner with occasional dinners at restaurant.

Even though your situation will be different, I am very sure that some expenses will be similar if you are planning to relocate as a couple or even as a single person.

# 2. Recurring expenses

Recurring expenses include rent, bills, taxes, groceries and transport.

- Rent of our 1 bedroom was at 1250 GBP pcm.
- All bills and tax together was at 250 GBP pcm.

The apartment was a one bedroom. Located in one of the cheapest area, at that time, on the east of London. 1250 pcm will be one of the cheapest rent that you will be able to find if you do not wish to share like us and decide to take a 1 bedroom apartment.

Living with my fiancee, we mostly ate at home. Our average monthly groceries spending was of 450 GBP. 

- Average monthly groceries spending was of 400 GBP pcm.

I was working from everyday so our transport spending was limited to going to buy groceries which adds up as a monthly expense to about 100 GBP for two. 

- Average monthly transport spending was of 100 GBP pcm.

Those recurring expenses add up to __2000 GBP pcm__ which __had__ to be spent in order to live.

# 3. Rent a place

We found our apartment with Foxtons. We had a lot of issues in finding an apprennent to rent as we did not have any __credit history__. Any rent is subject to credit check. Failing credit check would result in a rejection from the landlord.

_I am not sure about having a direct contract with landlord._

Our apartment was located in Pontoon Dock. The rent was at 1250 GBP pcm with a deposit of 2,5 months. Usual deposits go up to 1,5 months but in our case, with no rent history, we had to negotiate with the landlord to give her a higher security in exchange of her trust.

_Side note: We saw a lot of horror stories about deposit not returned but our deposit was refunded within three weeks after we vacated the property without any issues._

# 4. Bills

The bills to consider were the gas and electricity, the council tax, mobile phones and internet.

Gas and electricty was about 50 GBP per month for two persons. 
The council tax was of 110 GBP. This tax will depend on which area you will live in.
For mobile phones we used Giffgaff. Giffgaff is by far the best option for mobile plans, we were having a package of 500mb of data for 7.5GBP per month with unlimited call to other Giffgaff numbers. 500mb was enough for us as we stayed home most of the time.
Lastly for internet, we used Hyperoptic with a 20gb connection for 31 GBP per month.

Those were the expenses:

# 5. Groceries

For groceries, we used to buy groceries from Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsburry and Asda.

Living in Pontoon Dock, we could access to Tesco at Woolwich arsenal via DLR.
For Waitrose and Sainsburry, they are both located at Stratford which we could access via DLR. Lastly we used Asda for home delivery to deliver heavy items like water bottles.

As mentioned earlier, our spending per month in supermarket average around 450 GBP.
