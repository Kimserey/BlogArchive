# How does NgModule works in Angular

The first time I saw the NgModule decorator and its arguments I was completely lost. 
I couldn't understand what was the meaning of imports, declarations, exports, providers or bootstrap and I had a hard time finding clear explanations. 
So today I will go through each attributes and provide an explanation together with an example to understand what is the role of each NgModule argument.

# 1. How does a NgModule declaration look like?

Angular utilises the typescript decorators to define `NgModule`.
It accepts `imports`, `declarations`, `exports` and `providers`.

A typical declaration would look like that:

```
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { SquareComponent } from './square.component';
import { SquareService } from './square.service';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: [
    SquareComponent
  ],
  exports: [
    SquareComponent
  ],
  providers: [
    SquareService
  ]
})
export class SquareModule { }
```

Here we are __importing__ the `CommonModule` from `@angular/common` to give access to common directives like `ngIf` or `ngFor`.
Then we are __declaring__ the `SquareComponent` which is a component defined by ourselves.
Then we are __exporting__ it, so that other modules who import `SquareModule` can use the `SquareComponent`.
Lastly we are __providing__ a service, `SquareService` which we have defined ourselves and make it avaible for dependency injection. 

# 2. Imports

`Imports` in NgModule is an array of module. Use it to import 

# 3. Exports
# 4. Declarations
# 5. Providers
