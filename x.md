# Create a Android app from your WebSharper web app

With WebSharper, it is easy and quick to build web apps with F#.
If you followed my blog, you must have noticed that I regularly post about WebSharper functionalities.
Building Single Page Application using F# is one of the reason why I started to look into WebSharper.

Last week I covered how we could build a cross platform mobile app with Xamarin.Forms and I showed how we could deploy it to an Android VM using the Xamarin Android Player.

Today, I would like to show you how you can take your WebhSharper SPA and embed it into a Android app using Xamarin.Forms and finally deploy it to an Android emulator.

This post is composed by three parts:

1. Build a simple SPA
2. Build a Xamarin.Forms WebView and use it from an Android app
3. Load the SPA from the WebView

## 1. Build a simple SPA
