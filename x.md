# Build an accordion view in Xamarin.Forms

Few weeks ago I posted about [absolute and relative layouts]().
Layouts are called `Layouts` because they contain children which are placed in a particular way.
Xamarin.Forms has a lot of layouts and views to structure pages like grid, table view or list view.

Today I would like to show you how we can use some of these basic views to build an __Accordion view__.

Here's a preview of the Accordion view:
