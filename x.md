# Data exploration with Deedle

Data exploration is the process of taking data and manipulating it in such a way that it is workable with.
Real life data rarely come in a format exploitable for analysis, this is why data exploration is a necessary step.
It involves taking data from CSVs or databases, renaming, categorizing, reordering, transposing or pivoting tables and data.
Without any tools or libraries, it would be a pain to do these common operations.

`Deedle` is a library which simplifies data exploration by providing functions to execute common manipulation on dataframes and timeseries.

As I already went through how to get started with `Deedle` in a previous tutorial [https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/04/a-primer-on-manipulating-data-frame.html](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/04/a-primer-on-manipulating-data-frame.html),
today I would like to show more functionalities of `Deedle` and how they can be used in a real life scenario.

This post is composed by three parts:
 1. A reminder on what is a Deedle Frame
 2. Common statistical calculations
 3. Pivot table
