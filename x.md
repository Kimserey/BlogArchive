# Create a Android app from a WebSharper web app

With WebSharper, it is easy and quick to build web apps in F#.
If you followed my blog, you must have noticed that I regularly post about WebSharper functionalities.
Building Single Page Application using F# is one of the reason why I started to look into WebSharper.
Here is one of the first blog post I made on WebSharper:

Last week I covered how we could build a cross platform mobile app with Xamarin.Forms and I showed how we could deploy it to an Android VM using the Xamarin Android Player.

[https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/setup-your-environment-to-build-android.html](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/setup-your-environment-to-build-android.html)

Today, I would like to show you how you can take your WebhSharper SPA and embed it into a Android app using Xamarin.Forms to quickly transform your web app to a mobile app.

This post is composed by three parts:

1. Build a simple SPA
2. Build a Xamarin.Forms WebView
3. Embed your SPA in the Android app

## 1. Build a simple SPA

For this example, I built a simple SPA using `UI.Next`.

### 1.1 UI Element constructs

For the style of the web app, I used `Bootstrap`. I built some type helpers to represent the UI components that I am using.
I created a `Table`, `NavBar`, `Hyperlink` and `NavTabs` type. Each type provide a set of static functions used to configure the members which are used during rendering of the element.

The code can be found here:

`Hyperlink` - [https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.WebApp/Bootstrap.Hyperlink.fs](https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.WebApp/Bootstrap.Hyperlink.fs)

`Table` - [https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.WebApp/Bootstrap.Table.fs](https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.WebApp/Bootstrap.Table.fs)

`NavBar` - [https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.WebApp/Bootstrap.NavBar.fs](https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.WebApp/Bootstrap.NavBar.fs)

`NavTabs` - [https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.WebApp/Bootstrap.NavTabs.fs](https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.WebApp/Bootstrap.NavTabs.fs)

Using types to abstract UI elements construction is a powerful way to increase readability, reusability and type safety. 
The code then become pretty clean. For example, here's the definition of a `Table`:

```
let shopsTable() =
    Table.Empty
    |> Table.SetStyle [ TableStyle.Hover; TableStyle.Striped; TableStyle.Bordered ]
    |> Table.AddHeaders [ "#"; "Name"; "Location"; "Category" ]
    |> Table.AddRow (TableRow.Create [ text "1"; text "Waitrose"; text "London"; text "Supermarket" ] 
                    |> TableRow.OnClick (fun () -> route.Value <- Shop "Waitrose"))
    |> Table.AddRow (TableRow.Create [ text "2"; text "Aldi"; text "London"; text "Supermarket" ]
                    |> TableRow.OnClick (fun () -> route.Value <- Shop "Aldi"))
    |> Table.AddRow (TableRow.Create [ text "3"; text "Currys"; text "London"; text "Electronic" ]
                    |> TableRow.OnClick (fun () -> route.Value <- Shop "Currys"))
    |> Table.Render
``` 

You don't need to worry too much on the SPA, I will cover the way the UI elements are abstracted and the way they are constructed in the next blog post.

### 1.2 Route map router

In order to manage the urls, I used the `RouteMap` provided by `UI.Next`. A `RouteMap` is essentially a map between your endpoint type, which can be a discriminated union, and your urls.

```
type Endpoint =
    | Shop of string
    | Expense of string
    | Listing

let main =

    let route = 
        RouteMap.Create 
            (function 
                | Shop name    -> [ "shops"; name ] 
                | Expense name -> [ "expenses"; name ] 
                | Listing      -> [ "listing" ]) 
            (function
                | [ "shops"; name ]    -> Shop name
                | [ "expenses"; name ] -> Expense name
                | _                    -> Listing)
        |> RouteMap.Install
```

Installing the route map return a reactive variable that I called `route`.
Url routing is important as it will be required to navigate with the hardware back button. If the url is not properly changed, the user experience won't be great as the back button will exit the app.

The full web app project is available here:
[https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/tree/master/WebView.WebApp](https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/tree/master/WebView.WebApp)

Launching the `index.html` should be enough to run the whole SPA.

## 2. Build a Xamarin.Forms WebView and load your SPA

Now that we have a SPA, we need to configure a `WebView` and use it from an Android app.
A web view is essentially a web browser running inside an app. It is defined in a portacle library in F#  and the Android app is defined in a C# project.
For more information you can refer to my last week blog post on [how to setup your environment to build apps with Xamarin.Forms and deploy an Android emulator](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/setup-your-environment-to-build-android.html).

### 2.1 Xamarin.Forms WebView

To define a webview and load our own index.html, we need to instantiate the webview and set its `source` and `base url`.

The `source` represent what has to be loaded. In our case, we use `HtmlWebViewSource`. In `HtmlWebViewSource` we need to set the `Html` member and the `BaseUrl` member. `Base Url` represents the base url used to navigate on the page. All the relative path contents will be loaded using the `base url` therefore it is important that all `scripts` and `stylesheets` be loaded with a relative path.

```
type IBaseUrl =
    abstract member Get: unit -> string
        
module Core =
    let baseUrl =
        DependencyService.Get<IBaseUrl>().Get()

    let html = """
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>WebView.WebApp</title>
            <meta charset="utf-8" />
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
            <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
            <script src="js/jquery-1.12.4.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
            <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <div id="nav"></div>
            <div id="main" class="container-fluid"></div>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="Content/WebView.WebApp.min.js"></script>
        </body>
        </html>
    """
    let webView = new WebView(Source = new HtmlWebViewSource(Html = html, BaseUrl = baseUrl))
```

The way assets are handled is different for each platform. Therefore we need to use the `DependencyService` to get an instance of `IBaseUrl`.
`IBaseUrl` will be define in each platform specific project.

### 2.2 WebView back button support

Now that we have our `WebView`, we need to place it in a page in order to launch it on a Xamarin.Forms application.
While we place it in a `ContentPage`, we take the opportunity to override the `OnBackButtonPressed` function which is triggered when the hardware back button is pressed.
We can then instruct the `WebView` to go back in the browser history. 

_This is why implementing the router in WebSharper.UI.Next was important._

```
type WebViewPage() =
    inherit ContentPage(Content = Core.webView)
    
    override this.OnBackButtonPressed() =
        base.OnBackButtonPressed() |> ignore
        if Core.webView.CanGoBack then Core.webView.GoBack()
        true
```

Finally we place the page in a Xamarin.Forms application.

```
type App() = 
    inherit Application(MainPage = new WebViewPage())
```

The full code of the `WebView` can be found here:
[https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.Mobile/View.fs](https://github.com/Kimserey/WebView/blob/master/WebView.Mobile/View.fs)

## 3. Embed your SPA in the Android app

Now that we have our SPA, and we have a preconfigured `WebView`, we need to embed the content of the SPA into our Android project and provide an implementation of `IBaseUrl` to the `DependencyService`.

### 3.1 Embed all content into the Android project

In order to embed all contact, I have manually downloaded the full package of bootstrap and extracted the content into my web app.
If you carefully look at the `index.html` all links are relative paths.
A good way to verify that all resources are loaded locally is to open chrome debugger and check the Sources. 
If everything is loaded locally, you should have a tree with a single base `file://`.

![tree_file](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LSk8MbeRJPk/V0rbjW0EodI/AAAAAAAAALU/Ff56i7rAj4wy6TmNE9OAWYfqUABwvPscQCLcB/s320/tree_file.png)

What you need to do next is to take all the loaded folders and content `\Content`, `\css`, and `\js` and place it in the `Asset folder` of android.
Add the files to the project using the option `Add As Link`, this will be easier as each time you change the SPA, the `js` file changes. 

![link](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IhMHqTKF9YY/V0rgmX2VYzI/AAAAAAAAALk/u7zEbqWO3iMPXfKkS4Nd7cQMP08AB20wgCLcB/s320/link_file.png)

It will ensure that when deploying your Android app, it will always include the latest `js` files.
You should now have all your files with the linked icon.

![files](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0uNHBm4eE9A/V0rgcs8m08I/AAAAAAAAALg/UAdcHRweOzgChzV3MS7aJFf9-HoC2WvqwCLcB/s320/files.png)

### 3.2 Implement IBaseUrl and launch the app

In our Xamarin.Forms project, we declared a `IBaseUrl` interface. Now it is time to give it an implementation specific to Android.

```
[assembly: Dependency(typeof(BaseUrl))]
namespace WebView.Mobile.AndroidApp
{
    public class BaseUrl : WebView.Mobile.IBaseUrl
    {
        public string Get()
        {
            return "file:///android_asset/";
        }
    }
}
```

All we need to do is return `file:///android_asset/` which is the special path for the webview to access embedded files.
Lastely we load the app from the main activity.

```
[Activity(Label = "WebView.Mobile.AndroidApp", MainLauncher = true, Icon = "@drawable/icon")]
public class MainActivity : Xamarin.Forms.Platform.Android.FormsApplicationActivity
{
    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
    {
        base.OnCreate(bundle);

        Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(this, bundle);
        LoadApplication(new WebView.Mobile.App());
    }
}
```

Congratulation, you now deployed a WebSharper SPA to your Android emulator.

# Conclusion

Today we saw how we could take a SPA built in WebSharper and embed it into an Android app.
This technique can be quite useful if you want to quickly provide an app with an existing website.
If you don't need to make any external call, your app will be fully functional offline which is always good.
If you just need a mobile app, going with WebSharper would be overkill but if you need a web app and at the same time need a functional mobile app, 
implementing a WebView is definitly an approach to consider.
I hope this gave you some ideas and I look forward to see what you do with webviews.
