# Var, View, Lens, ListModel in UI.Next

Last week I needed to make a two way binding with a record which had nested list in.
I had a [conversation on WebSharper forum](http://websharper.com/question/81323/what-would-be-the-best-way-to-make-a-two-way-binding-on-a-record-from-a-list-of-list) with [@tarmil_](https://twitter.com/Tarmil_) and [@inchester23](https://twitter.com/inchester). It was so constructive that I thought I would share what I discovered with you.

I already covered the basic of `UI.Next` in a previous post on [how you can create a SPA with `UI.Next`](http://kimsereyblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/single-page-app-with-websharper-uinext.html),
have a look if you haven't yet but I will give a brief explanation of what was in the previous post and extend on the subject as well.

In this post we will see:
 1. The purpose of Var and View
 2. The purpose of ListModel
 3. The purpose of Lenses
 4. Use all we know in a sample

## Var and View

## ListModel

## Lens
