# Setup Continuous Integration and Deployment for dotnet library with Appveyor and FAKE

[Last week we saw a flow to manage versioning and releases](). As a continuation of last week, today I will show how we can setup versioning and releases for open source projects by configuring Appveyor and using FAKE to setup a build script.

1. Configure AppVeyor
2. FAKE

## 1. Configure AppVeyor

Configuring AppVeyor is done via a yaml file `appveyor.yml` at the root of the repository. Then from the site [https://www.appveyor.com/](https://www.appveyor.com/), we can sign in with our GitHub credentials and add the repository to the AppVeyor projects. All the settings in the settings tab can be configured in the yaml file.

`appveyor.yml` settings can be seen in multiple sections:

1. global environment
2. build
3. test
4. artifact
5. deploy

The `global configuration` is where we configure the context of the build,

```yml
# 1.
version: '{build}'
image: Visual Studio 2017
skip_branch_with_pr: true
skip_commits:
  files:
    - docs/**/*
    - '**/*.md'
    - .gitignore
pull_requests:
  do_not_increment_build_number: true
environment:
  VisualStudioVersion: 15.0
  BuildConfiguration: release
```

Here we set the `version` to the build number, `image` to the `Visual Studio 2017` image to have access to msbuild 15, set the build to not build branches with PR as PR themselves are built with `skip_branch_with_pr`, skip the build when commits in only on certain files, and lastly we set some global environment variables like the the build configuration to be `release`.

Next we run some installation prior running the build.

```yml
# 2.
install:
  - ps: choco install gitversion.portable -pre -y

build_script:
  - ps: .\fake run build.fsx -t All
```

`ps: choco install gitversion.portable -pre -y` is used to install [Gitversion which we talked about few weeks ago](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/2018/04/sementic-versioning-for-dotnet.html) and figure out the current version of the application or library to release. `ps: .\fake run build.fsx -t All` runs the FAKE build script which we will define in the second part.

Next we can define how we run tests, for this example we don't have any.

```yml
# 3.
test: off
```

Next we define where the build can find the artifacts, our build script will package the library in a NuGet package `.nupkg` and place them in a `artifacts` folder and we tell AppVeyor that it can find them and upload them from that folder.

```yml
# 4.
artifacts:
  - path: .\artifacts\**\*.nupkg
```

Lastly we setup two deployment, one to `NuGet` and the other one to `GitHub` releases. Each deployment requires a secure key which can be encrypted using the [Encrypt data tool from AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/tools/encrypt).

```yml
# 5.
deploy:
  - provider: NuGet
    api_key:
      secure: [secure key]
    on:
      appveyor_repo_tag: true

  - provider: GitHub
    description: ''
    release: '$(appveyor_repo_tag_name)'
    artifact: /.*\.nupkg/
    auth_token:
      secure: [secure key]
    on:
      appveyor_repo_tag: true
```

`on` is used to specified when the artifact gets deployed, here we specify that the deployment occurs on tag of the repository [as explained last week]().

The full file can be found on my [GitHub on a sample project](https://github.com/Kimserey/hello-world-nuget/blob/master/appveyor.yml) and a reference yaml from AppVeyor can be found on [their documentation page](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/appveyor-yml/).

## 2. FAKE

FAKE is a build tool which allows us to define targets and a pipeline fo building and packaging our .NET projects. Here we use it together with AppVeyor to build and package the application and trigger it in the `build` stage as we seen earlier using the command `ps: .\fake run build.fsx -t All`.

We start first by installing FAKE by running the following command (assuming that `dotnet` is already installed):

```
dotnet tool install fake-cli --tool-path .\.fake
```

This command installs FAKE on a local path under `.fake`. Then we install the `dotnet` FAKE template:

```
dotnet new -i "fake-template::*"
```

And lastly we bootstrap FAKE scripts:

```
dotnet new fake
```

This creates `build.fsx`, `fake.cmd`, `fake.sh` and files under `.fake`. Then we need to run the script first before starting to modify it so that all packages are downloaded via paket `.\fake.cmd build`.
Next we can build the four targets which constitute the build script:

1. Clean
2. UpdateBuildVersion
3. Build
4. Pack

### 2.1 Clean target

`Clean` target is used to clean all folders which need to be cleared before generating the files:

```fsharp
Target.create "Clean" (fun _ ->
    !! "**/bin"
    ++ "**/obj"
    ++ "**/artifacts"
    ++ "gitversion"
    |> Shell.deleteDirs
)
```

### 2.2 UpdateBuildVersion target

Next we deduce the version using `GitVersion` and update the AppVeyor build version using [AppVeyor API](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-worker-api/). We start first by defining some utility functions to execute a command and return a result, those will be used to execute the `gitversion /showvariable` command which prints the variable as result.

```fsharp
module Process =
    let private timeout =
        System.TimeSpan.FromMinutes 2.

    let execWithMultiResult f =
        Process.execWithResult f timeout
        |> fun r -> r.Messages

    let execWithSingleResult f =
        execWithMultiResult f
        |> List.head
```

Next we define some utility functions to return the version using `gitversion`.

```fsharp
module GitVersion =
    let showVariable =
        let commit =
            match Environment.environVarOrNone Environment.APPVEYOR_REPO_COMMIT with
            | Some c -> c
            | None -> Process.execWithSingleResult (fun info -> { info with FileName = "git"; Arguments = "rev-parse HEAD" })

        printfn "Executing gitversion from commit '%s'." commit

        fun variable ->
            match Environment.environVarOrNone Environment.APPVEYOR_REPO_BRANCH, Environment.environVarOrNone Environment.APPVEYOR_PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER with
            | Some branch, None ->
                Process.execWithSingleResult (fun info ->
                    { info with
                        FileName = "gitversion"
                        Arguments = sprintf "/showvariable %s /url %s /b b-%s /dynamicRepoLocation .\gitversion /c %s" variable Environment.REPOSITORY branch commit })
            | _ ->
                Process.execWithSingleResult (fun info -> { info with FileName = "gitversion"; Arguments = sprintf "/showvariable %s" variable })

    let get =
        let mutable value: Option<string * string * string> = None

        Target.createFinal "ClearGitVersionRepositoryLocation" (fun _ ->
            Shell.deleteDir "gitversion"
        )

        fun () ->
            match value with
            | None ->
                value <-
                    match Environment.environVarOrNone Environment.APPVEYOR_REPO_TAG_NAME with
                    | Some v -> Some (v, showVariable "AssemblySemVer", v)
                    | None -> Some (showVariable "FullSemVer", showVariable "AssemblySemVer", showVariable "NuGetVersionV2")

                Target.activateFinal "ClearGitVersionRepositoryLocation"
                Option.get value
            | Some v -> v
```

`showVariable` will get the current commit by either looking into the environment variable provided by AppVeyor or deducing the current commit by using `git rev-parse HEAD` and return a function as result which given the `variable` to show will use `gitversion` process either on a remote repository for branches or on the local repository for pull requests.

The command executed for `gitversion` on a remote repostiory is `gitversion /showvariable fullSemVer /url [my-repo.git] /b b-[my-branch] /dynamicRepoLocation .\gitversion /c [sha1]`. This will download locally the repository under `.\gitversion`, and create a branch `b-branch` which will allow `gitversion` to calculate the version based on that branch. Next we define a getter which when invoked declares a final target which cleans the `gitversion` folder and activate it when getter is invoked for the first time.

Lastly we can define the target and use it.

```fsharp
Target.create "UpdateBuildVersion" (fun _ ->
    let (fullSemVer, _, _) = GitVersion.get()

    Shell.Exec("appveyor", sprintf "UpdateBuild -Version \"%s (%s)\"" fullSemVer (Environment.environVar Environment.APPVEYOR_BUILD_NUMBER))
    |> ignore
)
```

### 2.3 Build

```fsharp
Target.create "Build" (fun _ ->
    let (fullSemVer, assemblyVer, _) = GitVersion.get()

    let setParams (buildOptions: DotNet.BuildOptions) =
        { buildOptions with
            Common = { buildOptions.Common with DotNet.CustomParams = Some (sprintf "/p:Version=%s /p:FileVersion=%s" fullSemVer assemblyVer) }
            Configuration = DotNet.BuildConfiguration.fromEnvironVarOrDefault Environment.BUILD_CONFIGURATION DotNet.BuildConfiguration.Debug }

    !! "**/*.*proj"
    -- "**/gitversion/**/*.*proj"
    |> Seq.iter (DotNet.build setParams)
)
```

### 2.4 Pack

```fsharp
Target.create "Pack" (fun _ ->
    let (_, _, nuGetVer) = GitVersion.get()

    let setParams (packOptions: DotNet.PackOptions) =
        { packOptions with
            Configuration = DotNet.BuildConfiguration.fromEnvironVarOrDefault Environment.BUILD_CONFIGURATION DotNet.BuildConfiguration.Debug
            OutputPath = Some "../artifacts"
            NoBuild = true
            Common = { packOptions.Common with CustomParams = Some (sprintf "/p:PackageVersion=%s" nuGetVer) } }

    !! "**/*.*proj"
    -- "**/gitversion/**/*.*proj"
    |> Seq.iter (DotNet.pack setParams)
)
```
